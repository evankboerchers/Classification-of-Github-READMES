19,3,https://github.com/sethm/symon,# SYMON - A 6502 System Simulator,14,sethm.symon.md,1,"===============================  **Version:** 1.2.1  **Last Updated:** 8 January, 2016  See the file COPYING for license.  ![Symon Simulator in Action](http://www.loomcom.com/symon/screenshots/full.jpg) "
20,3,https://github.com/sethm/symon,## 1.0 About,1246,sethm.symon.md,2," Symon is a general purpose simulator for systems based on the MOS Technologies 6502 microprocessor and compatibles. Symon is implemented in Java. Its core goals are accuracy, ease of development, clear documentation, and extensive test suites for validating correctness.  Symon simulates a complete system with a 1 MHz NMOS 6502, 32KB of RAM, 16KB of ROM, a MOS 6551 or Motorola 6850 ACIA, a MOS 6522 VIA, and an experimental 6545 CRTC.  Symon has extensive unit tests to verify correctness, and fully passes Klaus Dormann's 6502 Functional Test Suite as of version 0.8.2 (See [this thread on the 6502.org Forums](http://forum.6502.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=2241) for more information about this functional test suite).  Symon is under constant, active development. Feedback and patches are always welcome. "
21,3,https://github.com/sethm/symon,## 2.0 Requirements,3,sethm.symon.md,2,   - Java 1.8 or higher   - Maven 2.0.x or higher (for building from source)   - JUnit 4 or higher (for testing) 
22,3,https://github.com/sethm/symon,## 3.0 Features,1,sethm.symon.md,2," Symon can simulate multiple 6502 based architectures. At present, three machines are implemented: Symon (the default), MULTICOMP, and a ""Simple"" machine useful for debugging. "
23,3,https://github.com/sethm/symon,### 3.1 Memory Maps,1,sethm.symon.md,3,
24,3,https://github.com/sethm/symon,#### 3.1.1 Symon Memory Map,1,sethm.symon.md,4,   - `$0000`--`$7FFF`: 32KB RAM   - `$8000`--`$800F`: 6522 VIA   - `$8800`--`$8803`: MOS 6551 ACIA (Serial Console)   - `$9000`--`$9001`: MOS 6545 CRTC   - `$C000`--`$FFFF`: 16KB ROM  The CRT Controller uses memory address `$7000` as the start of Video memory. 
25,3,https://github.com/sethm/symon,#### 3.1.2 MULTICOMP Memory Map,1,sethm.symon.md,4,   - `$0000`--`$DFFF`: 56KB RAM   - `$E000`--`$FFFF`: 8KB ROM   - `$FFD0`--`$FFD1`: Motorola 6850 ACIA   - `$FFD8`--`$FFDF`: Controller for SD cards 
26,3,https://github.com/sethm/symon,### 3.1.3 Simple Memory Map,1,sethm.symon.md,3,   - `$0000`--`$FFFF`: 64KB RAM 
27,3,https://github.com/sethm/symon,### 3.2 Serial Console and CPU Status,1,sethm.symon.md,3," ![Serial Console](http://www.loomcom.com/symon/screenshots/console.png)  The main window of the simulator acts as the primary Input/Output system through a virtual serial terminal. The terminal is attached to a simulated ACIA, including a programmable baud rate generator that tries to approximate the correct ""feel"" of the programmed baud rate. (The sample Enhanced BASIC ROM image is programmed for 9600 baud)  It also provides CPU status. Contents of the accumulator, index registers, processor status flags, disassembly of the instruction register, and stack pointer are all displayed.  ![Font Selection](http://www.loomcom.com/symon/screenshots/font_selection.png)  The console supports font sizes from 10 to 20 points. "
28,3,https://github.com/sethm/symon,### 3.3 ROM Loading,1,sethm.symon.md,3," ![ROM Loading](http://www.loomcom.com/symon/screenshots/load_rom.png)  Symon can load any appropriately sized ROM image. The Symon architecture expects as 16KB (16384 byte) ROM image, while the MULTICOMP architecture expects an 8KB (8192 byte) ROM image. Images are loaded via the ""Load ROM..."" action in the ""File"" menu. The selected ROM file will be loaded into memory at the correct ROM base address. "
29,3,https://github.com/sethm/symon,### 3.4 Memory Window,1,sethm.symon.md,3, ![Memory Window](http://www.loomcom.com/symon/screenshots/memory_window.png)  Memory contents can be viewed (and edited) one page at a time through the Memory Window. 
30,3,https://github.com/sethm/symon,### 3.5 Trace Log,1,sethm.symon.md,3," ![Trace Log](http://www.loomcom.com/symon/screenshots/trace_log.png)  The last 20,000 execution steps are disassembled and logged to the Trace Log Window. "
31,3,https://github.com/sethm/symon,### 3.6 Simulator Speeds,1,sethm.symon.md,3, ![Speeds](http://www.loomcom.com/symon/screenshots/simulator_menu.png)  Simulated speeds may be set from 1MHz to 8MHz. 
32,3,https://github.com/sethm/symon,### 3.7 Breakpoints,1,sethm.symon.md,3, ![Breakpoints](http://www.loomcom.com/symon/screenshots/breakpoints.png)  Breakpoints can be set and removed through the Breakpoints window. 
33,3,https://github.com/sethm/symon,### 3.8 Experimental 6545 CRTC Video,16,sethm.symon.md,3," ![Composite Video](http://www.loomcom.com/symon/screenshots/video_window.png)  This feature is highly experimental. It's possible to open a video window from the ""View"" menu.  This window simulates the output of a MOS 6545 CRT Controller located at address `$9000` and `$9001`.  By default, the 40 x 25 character display uses video memory located at base address `$7000`.  This means that the memory from address `$7000` (28672 decimal) to `$73E8` (29672 decimal) is directly mapped to video.    - Address Register (at address `$9000`)   - R1: Horizontal Displayed Columns   - R6: Vertical Displayed Rows   - R9: Scan Lines per Row   - R10: Cursor Start Scan Line and Cursor Control Mode   - R11: Cursor End Scan Line   - R12: Display Start Address (High Byte)   - R13: Display Start Address (Low Byte)   - R14: Cursor Position (High Byte)   - R15: Cursor Position (Low Byte)  Although the simulation is pretty good, there are a few key differences between the simulated 6545 and a real 6545:    - The simulated 6545 supports only the straight binary addressing     mode of the real 6545, and not the Row/Column addressing mode.    - The simulated 6545 has full 16 bit addressing, where the real 6545     has only a 14-bit address bus.    - The simulation is done at a whole-frame level, meaning that lots     of 6545 programming tricks that were achieved by updating the     frame address during vertical and horizontal sync times are not     achievable.  There is no way (for example) to change the Display Start     Address (R12 and R13) while a frame is being drawn.  For more information on the 6545 CRTC and its programming model, please see the following resources    - [CRTC 6545/6845 Information (André Fachat)](http://6502.org/users/andre/hwinfo/crtc/index.html)   - [CRTC Operation (André Fachat)](http://www.6502.org/users/andre/hwinfo/crtc/crtc.html)   - [MOS 6545 Datasheet (PDF)](http://www.6502.org/users/andre/hwinfo/crtc/crtc.html)  "
34,3,https://github.com/sethm/symon,#### 3.8.1 Example BASIC Program to test Video,1,sethm.symon.md,4," This program will fill the video screen with all printable characters.      10 J = 0     20 FOR I = 28672 TO 29672     30 POKE I,J     40 IF J < 255 THEN J = J + 1 ELSE J = 0     50 NEXT I     60 END "
35,3,https://github.com/sethm/symon,## 4.0 Usage,3,sethm.symon.md,2,
36,3,https://github.com/sethm/symon,### 4.1 Building,3,sethm.symon.md,3," To build Symon with Apache Maven, just type:      $ mvn package  Maven will build Symon, run unit tests, and produce a jar file in the `target` directory containing the compiled simulator.  Symon is meant to be invoked directly from the jar file. To run with Java 1.8 or greater, just type:      $ java -jar symon-1.2.0.jar  When Symon is running, you should be presented with a simple graphical interface. "
37,3,https://github.com/sethm/symon,### 4.2 ROM images,3,sethm.symon.md,3," The simulator requires a ROM image loaded into memory to work properly. Without a ROM in memory, the simulator will not be able to reset, since the reset vector for the 6502 is located in the ROM address space.  By default, any file named `rom.bin` that exists in the same directory where Symon is launched will be loaded as a ROM image. ROM images can also be swapped out at run-time with the ""Load ROM Image..."" in the File menu.  The ""samples"" directory contains a ROM image for the Symon architecture named 'ehbasic.rom', containing Lee Davison's Enhanced 6502 BASIC. This serves as a good starting point for exploration.  *Note*: Presently, EhBASIC only works with the Symon machine  architecture, not with MULTICOMP. "
38,3,https://github.com/sethm/symon,### 4.3 Loading A Program,3,sethm.symon.md,3," In addition to ROM images, programs in the form of raw binary object files can be loaded directly into memory from ""Load Program..."" in the File menu.  Programs are loaded starting at addres $0300.  After loading the program, the simulated CPU's reset vector is loaded with the values $00, $03, and the CPU is reset.  There are two very simple sample program in the ""samples"" directory, for testing.  - 'echo.prg' will echo back anything typed at the console.  - 'hello.prg' will continuously print ""Hello, 6502 World!"" to the console. "
39,3,https://github.com/sethm/symon,### 4.4 Running,3,sethm.symon.md,3," After loading a program or ROM image, clicking ""Run"" will start the simulator running. "

41,3,https://github.com/sethm/symon,## 6.0 Roadmap,4,sethm.symon.md,2,   - **1.2:** Better breakpoint support. Symbolic debugging of breakpoints.    - **2.0:** Complete rewrite of the UI in JavaFX instead of Swing. Complete     assembler and disassembler built in. Ability to attach source code for     symbolic debugging. 
42,3,https://github.com/sethm/symon,## 7.0 To Do,4,sethm.symon.md,2,"   - Feedback (in the form of dialogs, status bar, etc).    - Better debugging tools from the UI, including breakpoints     and disassembly.    - UI needs a ton more polish.    - More extensive testing.    - Clean up JavaDoc.    - Implement CMOS 65C02 instructions and NMOS / CMOS mode flag.    - Allow displaying ACIA status and dumping ACIA buffers, for     debugging.    - CRTC emulation is very naive. The whole frame is drawn in one     CPU step. This should be improved by drawing scan lines during     machine steps to approximate real NTSC/PAL refresh rates.    - Symbolic debugging. "

46,4,https://github.com/lastromanticx/oo-inheritance-code-along-wdf-000,## Objectives,12,lastromanticx.oo-inheritance-code-along-wdf-000.md,2, 1. Learn about inheritance in object oriented Ruby. 2. Write classes that inherit from another class. 
47,4,https://github.com/lastromanticx/oo-inheritance-code-along-wdf-000,## Introduction: Why Inheritance?,12,lastromanticx.oo-inheritance-code-along-wdf-000.md,2," In the real-world, different entities (people, animals, cars, you name it) are related in various ways. Within a single entity or group, there exist systems of classification. For example, the ""dogs"" entity or category includes pugs, corgis, labs, etc. All of these breeds share common features because they are all dogs. But they all have certain unique traits as well.  Another example: you are writing a web application in which users are either admins, instructors or students. All of these entities are ""users"" and have common features, but they all have some unique traits as well.  How can our code reflect that fact that these different categories of things all share some, or even many, characteristics but all have some unique attributes as well? Well, we could write separate admin, instructor and student class that each contain repetitious code to lend each of these classes shared attributes and behaviors. We know, however, that repetitious code is always something to be avoided. Not only is it time consuming but, what happens when we need to make a change to this shared behavior? We'd have to code the same change in three places.  Instead, we can use **inheritance**. The use of inheritance allows us to create a family of classes with shared behavior, while still differentiating those classes. With inheritance, we could *inherit* the admin, instructor and student classes from a user class. Then, any changes made to the user class would apply to the other class.  While you may not write your own classes that use inheritance very frequently, you will encounter it frequently as a Ruby on Rails web developer. Once we introduce the use of databases and the challenge of connecting our programs to our database, you'll encounter inheritance in nearly every program you write for the web. More on that (much) later. "
48,4,https://github.com/lastromanticx/oo-inheritance-code-along-wdf-000,## What is Inheritance?,1,lastromanticx.oo-inheritance-code-along-wdf-000.md,2," In Ruby, classes can inherit from one another. This means that they adopt all of the attributes and behaviors (i.e. all of the methods) of the parent, also called the **super** class. In this exercise, we'll be building our own chain of inheritance. "
49,4,https://github.com/lastromanticx/oo-inheritance-code-along-wdf-000,## Code Along: Basic Inheritance,3,lastromanticx.oo-inheritance-code-along-wdf-000.md,2," In this domain model, we have class `Vehicle` that will act as the parent, or super, class. We will create child classes, also known as **subclasses** for different types of `Vehicle`s, such as car. "
50,4,https://github.com/lastromanticx/oo-inheritance-code-along-wdf-000,### Step 1: Defining the Super Class,3,lastromanticx.oo-inheritance-code-along-wdf-000.md,3," Open up `lib/super_vehicle.rb`. We're going to define some methods in this parent class so that our subclasses, when we make them, will have access to them.  ```ruby class Vehicle    attr_accessor :wheel_size, :wheel_number    def initialize(wheel_size, wheel_number)     @wheel_size = wheel_size     @wheel_number = wheel_number   end    def go     ""vrrrrrrrooom!""   end    def fill_up_tank     ""filling up!""   end  end ```  Instances of `Vehicle` initialize with a wheel size and number. We also have `#go` and `#fill_up_tank` instance methods that describe some common vehicle behavior.  Go ahead and run the test suite and you'll see that you are passing all of the tests for the `Vehicle` class but none of the tests for the `Car` class. "
51,4,https://github.com/lastromanticx/oo-inheritance-code-along-wdf-000,### Step 2: Defining the Subclass,3,lastromanticx.oo-inheritance-code-along-wdf-000.md,3," Open up `lib/sub_car.rb`. Notice that we are requiring `lib/super_vehicle.rb`. That is because our `Car` class will need access to the `Vehicle` class and will therefore need access to the file that contains that class.  Go ahead and define the class in the following way:  ```ruby class Car < Vehicle  end ```  We use the `<` to inherit the `Car` class from `Vehicle`. Notice that there are *no methods defined in the `Car` class*.  Run the test suite again and you'll see that you are passing a number of tests for the `Car` class.  Wow! We didn't write *anything* in our `Car` class but instances of `Car` class *inherit* all of the `Vehicle` methods and therefore have access to them. We're still failing the `#go` test however. Looks like the test is expecting the `#go` method on an individual car to return the phrase: `""VRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!!!""`. This is different than the return value of the `#go` method that we inherited from the `Vehicle` class.  Let's overwrite the inherited `go` method with one specific to `Car`. "
52,4,https://github.com/lastromanticx/oo-inheritance-code-along-wdf-000,### Step 3: Overwriting Inherited Methods,3,lastromanticx.oo-inheritance-code-along-wdf-000.md,3," In `lib/sub_car.rb`, write the following method:  ```ruby class Car < Vehicle   def go     ""VRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!!!""   end end ```  Now, run the tests again and you should be passing all of them. "
53,4,https://github.com/lastromanticx/oo-inheritance-code-along-wdf-000,#### Method Look-Up in Ruby,3,lastromanticx.oo-inheritance-code-along-wdf-000.md,4," How does our above example work? Well, when your program is being executed, at the point at which the `#go` method is invoked, the compiler will first look in the class to which the instance of car that we are calling the method on belongs. If it finds a `#go` method there, it will execute *that method*. If it doesn't find such a method there, it will move on to look in the parent class that this class inherits from.  <a href='https://learn.co/lessons/oo-inheritance-code-along' data-visibility='hidden'>View this lesson on Learn.co</a>  <p data-visibility='hidden'>View <a href='https://learn.co/lessons/oo-inheritance-code-along'>Intro to Inheritance</a> on Learn.co and start learning to code for free.</p>"

That's why we built Prerender. Prerender is perfect for AngularJS SEO, BackboneJS SEO, EmberJS SEO, and any other javascript framework.  Behind the scenes, Prerender is a node server from [prerender.io](http://prerender.io) that uses phantomjs to create static HTML out of a javascript page. We host this as a service at [prerender.io](http://prerender.io) but we also open sourced it because we believe basic SEO is a right, not a privilege!  It should be used in conjunction with [these middleware libraries](#middleware) to serve the prerendered HTML to crawlers for SEO. Get started in two lines of code using [Rails](https://github.com/prerender/prerender_rails) or [Node](https://github.com/prerender/prerender-node).  Prerender adheres to google's `_escaped_fragment_` proposal, which we recommend you use. It's easy: - Just add &lt;meta name=""fragment"" content=""!""> to the &lt;head> of all of your pages - If you use hash urls (#), change them to the hash-bang (#!) - That's it! Perfect SEO on javascript pages.  Prerender includes lots of plugins, for example using Amazon S3 to [cache your prerendered HTML](#s3-html-cache). Prerender also starts multiple phantomjs processes to maximize throughput.  "

We use a plugin system in the same way that Connect and Express use middleware. Our plugins are a little different and we don't want to confuse the prerender plugins with the [prerender middleware](#middleware), so we opted to call them ""plugins"".  Plugins are in the `lib/plugins` directory, and add functionality to the prerender service.  Each plugin can implement any of the plugin methods: "

79,5,https://github.com/microlv/prerender,### basicAuth,3,microlv.prerender.md,3," If you want to only allow access to your Prerender server from authorized parties, enable the basic auth plugin.  You will need to add the `BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME` and `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` environment variables. ``` export BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME=prerender export BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=test ```  Then make sure to pass the basic authentication headers (password base64 encoded).  ``` curl -u prerender:wrong http://localhost:1337/http://example.com -> 401 curl -u prerender:test http://localhost:1337/http://example.com -> 200 ``` "
80,5,https://github.com/microlv/prerender,### removeScriptTags,3,microlv.prerender.md,3," We remove script tags because we don't want any framework specific routing/rendering to happen on the rendered HTML once it's executed by the crawler. The crawlers may not execute javascript, but we'd rather be safe than have something get screwed up.  For example, if you rendered the HTML of an angular page but left the angular scripts in there, your browser would try to execute the angular routing and rendering on a page that no longer has any angular bindings. "
81,5,https://github.com/microlv/prerender,### httpHeaders,3,microlv.prerender.md,3," If your Javascript routing has a catch-all for things like 404's, you can tell the prerender service to serve a 404 to google instead of a 200. This way, google won't index your 404's.  Add these tags in the `<head>` of your page if you want to serve soft http headers. Note: Prerender will still send the HTML of the page. This just modifies the status code and headers being sent.  Example: telling prerender to server this page as a 404 ```html <meta name=""prerender-status-code"" content=""404""> ```  Example: telling prerender to serve this page as a 302 redirect ```html <meta name=""prerender-status-code"" content=""302""> <meta name=""prerender-header"" content=""Location: http://www.google.com""> ``` "
82,5,https://github.com/microlv/prerender,### whitelist,3,microlv.prerender.md,3," If you only want to allow requests to a certain domain, use this plugin to cause a 404 for any other domains.  You can add the whitelisted domains to the plugin itself, or use the `ALLOWED_DOMAINS` environment variable.  `export ALLOWED_DOMAINS=www.prerender.io,prerender.io` "
83,5,https://github.com/microlv/prerender,### blacklist,3,microlv.prerender.md,3," If you want to disallow requests to a certain domain, use this plugin to cause a 404 for the domains.  You can add the blacklisted domains to the plugin itself, or use the `BLACKLISTED_DOMAINS` environment variable.  `export BLACKLISTED_DOMAINS=yahoo.com,www.google.com`  "

85,5,https://github.com/microlv/prerender,### s3HtmlCache,3,microlv.prerender.md,3," A `GET` request will check S3 for a cached copy. If a cached copy is found, it will return that. Otherwise, it will make the request to your server and then persist the HTML to the S3 cache.  A `POST` request will skip the S3 cache. It will make a request to your server and then persist the HTML to the S3 cache. The `POST` is meant to update the cache.  You'll need to sign up with Amazon Web Services and export these 3 environment variables.  ``` $ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<aws access key> $ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<aws secret access key> $ export S3_BUCKET_NAME=<bucket name> ```  Warning! Your keys should be kept private and you'll be charged for all files uploaded to S3.  > If Prerender is hosted on a EC2 instance, you can also take advantage of [IAM instance roles](http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2012/06/iam-roles-for-ec2-instances-simplified-secure-access-to-aws-service-apis-from-ec2.html) so that you don't need to export your AWS credentials.  > You can also export the S3_PREFIX_KEY variable so that the key (which is by default the complete requested URL) is prefixed. This is useful if you want to organize the snapshots in the same bucket. "
86,5,https://github.com/microlv/prerender,#### Region support,3,microlv.prerender.md,4," By default, s3HtmlCache works with the US Standard region (East), if your bucket is localized in another region you can config it with an environment variable : `AWS_REGION`.  ``` $ export AWS_REGION=<region name> ```  For example :  ``` $ export AWS_REGION=eu-west-1 ``` "
87,5,https://github.com/microlv/prerender,### inMemoryHtmlCache,3,microlv.prerender.md,3," The default is an in memory cache but you can easily change it to any caching system compatible with the `cache-manager` nodejs package.

One is non-fix LayoutHelper such as LinearLayoutHelper, GridLayoutHelper, etc which means the children of these LayoutHelper will be layouted in the flow of parent container and will be scrolled with the container scrolling. While the other is fix LayoutHelper which means the child of these is always fix in parent container.  "

117,9,https://github.com/LoMicah03/hello-world-ruby-ruby-intro-000,## Objectives,1,LoMicah03.hello-world-ruby-ruby-intro-000.md,2," 1. Create a new Ruby file. 2. Write syntactically valid code to produce ""Hello World!"" 3. Run a Ruby file. 4. Run the Learn gem. 5. Submit a Learn lab. "
118,9,https://github.com/LoMicah03/hello-world-ruby-ruby-intro-000,## Instructions,3,LoMicah03.hello-world-ruby-ruby-intro-000.md,2, Get started by clicking the Open button in Learn. 
119,9,https://github.com/LoMicah03/hello-world-ruby-ruby-intro-000,### Creating a File,3,LoMicah03.hello-world-ruby-ruby-intro-000.md,3," You will need to create a text file called `hello_world.rb` within the lab's directory. The `.rb` file extension is a common convention for specifying the language of the file - in this case, Ruby. To create this, in the Learn IDE's terminal type `touch hello_world.rb`. If that worked as expected, you should now see the file appear in the file browser. You can open this file by double clicking on it in the file browser or by typing `atom hello_world.rb`. You should now see an empty file open in your text editor, ready to be edited. "
120,9,https://github.com/LoMicah03/hello-world-ruby-ruby-intro-000,### Writing Code,3,LoMicah03.hello-world-ruby-ruby-intro-000.md,3," In the file `hello_world.rb` that you created, you need to write a single line of code that prints the string Hello World! to your terminal. To print in Ruby, you need to use the method `puts` which is short for ""out**put s**tring."" And because Hello World! is a string, you need to surround your text with `""""`.  File: `hello_world.rb` ```ruby puts ""Hello World!"" ```  Anytime you make changes to a file, such as the one you've just made, you need to save it so these changes are preserved. If you forget to save it before you run your tests, it will be tested against an empty document! Always remember to save it every time you make changes by selecting Save from the File menu. "
121,9,https://github.com/LoMicah03/hello-world-ruby-ruby-intro-000,### Executing Your File,3,LoMicah03.hello-world-ruby-ruby-intro-000.md,3," Execute this file by typing `ruby hello_world.rb` into your terminal and pressing `enter`. The `ruby` part of that command tells your computer to use the Ruby interpreter when reading and executing the code in your file. The second part of the command, `hello_world.rb` is the path to the file you want to run.  Note: be sure to save your file before trying to print, otherwise it will not work.  You should see:  ```bash $ ruby hello_world.rb Hello World! ``` "
122,9,https://github.com/LoMicah03/hello-world-ruby-ruby-intro-000,### Running Learn,3,LoMicah03.hello-world-ruby-ruby-intro-000.md,3," Confirm everything is working by running the `learn` command. You should see that all tests are passing (e.g. no red error text).  Note: When you write code, the case (uppercase/lowercase) of characters matters, and so your test will not pass unless you print ""Hello World!"" exactly. "

163,14,https://github.com/sineed/rails,# Welcome to Rails,1,sineed.rails.md,1," Rails is a web-application framework that includes everything needed to create database-backed web applications according to the [Model-View-Controller (MVC)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller) pattern.  Understanding the MVC pattern is key to understanding Rails. MVC divides your application into three layers, each with a specific responsibility.  The _Model layer_ represents your domain model (such as Account, Product, Person, Post, etc.) and encapsulates the business logic that is specific to your application. In Rails, database-backed model classes are derived from `ActiveRecord::Base`. Active Record allows you to present the data from database rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic methods. You can read more about Active Record in its [README](activerecord/README.rdoc). Although most Rails models are backed by a database, models can also be ordinary Ruby classes, or Ruby classes that implement a set of interfaces as provided by the Active Model module. You can read more about Active Model in its [README](activemodel/README.rdoc).  The _Controller layer_ is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and providing a suitable response. Usually this means returning HTML, but Rails controllers can also generate XML, JSON, PDFs, mobile-specific views, and more. Controllers load and manipulate models, and render view templates in order to generate the appropriate HTTP response. In Rails, incoming requests are routed by Action Dispatch to an appropriate controller, and controller classes are derived from `ActionController::Base`. Action Dispatch and Action Controller are bundled together in Action Pack. You can read more about Action Pack in its [README](actionpack/README.rdoc).  The _View layer_ is composed of ""templates"" that are responsible for providing appropriate representations of your application's resources. Templates can come in a variety of formats, but most view templates are HTML with embedded Ruby code (ERB files). Views are typically rendered to generate a controller response, or to generate the body of an email. In Rails, View generation is handled by Action View. You can read more about Action View in its [README](actionview/README.rdoc).  Active Record, Active Model, Action Pack, and Action View can each be used independently outside Rails. In addition to that, Rails also comes with Action Mailer ([README](actionmailer/README.rdoc)), a library to generate and send emails; Active Job ([README](activejob/README.md)), a framework for declaring jobs and making them run on a variety of queueing backends; Action Cable ([README](actioncable/README.md)), a framework to integrate WebSockets with a Rails application; and Active Support ([README](activesupport/README.rdoc)), a collection of utility classes and standard library extensions that are useful for Rails, and may also be used independently outside Rails.

You can do this either by completing the previously indicated tutorials, or you can use one of the following Mobile Apps backend projects:  + [.NET backend quickstart project for Mobile Apps](https://github.com/azure-samples/app-service-mobile-dotnet-backend-quickstart)  The readme file in this project will direct you to create a new Mobile App backend in App Service, then download, modify, and publish project to App Service.  After you have your new Mobile App backend running, you can configure this project to connect to that new backend. "

However, you need to configure the project, including authentication and push notifications, before the app will run properly. "
172,15,https://github.com/ggailey777/app-service-mobile-xamarin-android-quickstart-old,### Set the Mobile App backend URL,3,ggailey777.app-service-mobile-xamarin-android-quickstart-old.md,3," The first thing you need to do is to set the URL of your Mobile App backend in the **MobileServiceClient** constructor. To do this, open the ToDoActivity.cs project file, locate the `applicationURL` constant and replace the URL with the URL of your Mobile App backend.  "
173,15,https://github.com/ggailey777/app-service-mobile-xamarin-android-quickstart-old,### Configure authentication,3,ggailey777.app-service-mobile-xamarin-android-quickstart-old.md,3," Because both the client and backend are configured to use authentication, you must define an authentication provider for your app and register it with your Mobile App backend in the [portal](https://portal.azure.com).  1. Follow the instructions in the topic to configure the Mobile App backend to use one of the following authentication providers:  	+ [AAD](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-service-mobile-how-to-configure-active-directory-authentication/) 	+ [Facebook](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-service-mobile-how-to-configure-facebook-authentication/) 	+ [Google](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-service-mobile-how-to-configure-google-authentication/) 	+ [Microsoft account](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-service-mobile-how-to-configure-microsoft-authentication/) 	+ [Twitter](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-service-mobile-how-to-configure-twitter-authentication/)  2. By default, the app is configured to use server-directed Facebook authentication. To use a different authentication provider, change the provider by changing the value of the `provider` constant in ToDoActivity.cs and changing it to one of these other values: `AAD`, `Google`, `MicrosoftAccount`, or `Twitter`. "
174,15,https://github.com/ggailey777/app-service-mobile-xamarin-android-quickstart-old,### Configure push notifications,3,ggailey777.app-service-mobile-xamarin-android-quickstart-old.md,3," You need to configure push notifications by registering your Xamarin.Android app for Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) in the [Google developer console](https://console.developers.google.com), and then storing the API key in Azure. This key is used by Azure to connect to GCM to send push notifications.  Assuming that you have already created the notification hub in your backend as instructed in the server project readme, complete the following sections of the push notifications tutorial to configure push notifications:  2. [Register your app for push notifications](https://github.com/Azure/azure-content/blob/master/includes/mobile-services-enable-google-cloud-messaging.md). 3. [Configure the backend to send push notifications](https://github.com/Azure/azure-content/blob/master/includes/app-service-mobile-android-configure-push.md).  Finally, open the ToDoBroadcastReceiver.cs project file and set your Google project number in the senderIDs variable      public class ToDoBroadcastReceiver : GcmBroadcastReceiverBase<PushHandlerService>     {         // Set the Google app ID.         public static string[] senderIDs = new string[] { ""MY_PROJECT_NUMBER"" };     } "
175,15,https://github.com/ggailey777/app-service-mobile-xamarin-android-quickstart-old,## Running the app,3,ggailey777.app-service-mobile-xamarin-android-quickstart-old.md,2," With both the Mobile App backend and the app configured, you can run the app project.  1. In the Android emulator or device, make sure you have a valid Google account added.  2. Run the app, click the **Sign-in** button and authenticate with the provider.  	After authentication succeeds, the device is registered for push notifications and any existing data is downloaded from Azure.  2. Stop the Windows Store app and repeat the previous steps for the Windows Phone Store app.  	At this point, both devices are registered to receive push notifications.  3. Run the Windows Store app again, and type text in **Insert a TodoItem**, and then click **Save**.     	Note that after the insert completes, both the Windows Store and the Windows Phone apps receive a push notification from WNS. The notification is displayed on Windows Phone even when the app isn't running.  "
176,15,https://github.com/ggailey777/app-service-mobile-xamarin-android-quickstart-old,## Implementation notes,6,ggailey777.app-service-mobile-xamarin-android-quickstart-old.md,2,This section highlights changes made to the original tutorial samples and other design decisions were made when implementing all of the features or Mobile Apps in the same client app. 
177,15,https://github.com/ggailey777/app-service-mobile-xamarin-android-quickstart-old,###Template push notification registration,36,ggailey777.app-service-mobile-xamarin-android-quickstart-old.md,3,"The original push notification tutorial used a native WNS registration. This sample has been changed to use a template registration, which makes it easier to send push notifications to users on multiple clients from a single **send** method call. The following code defines the toast template registration:  	// Define a message body for GCM. 	const string templateBodyGCM = ""{\""data\"":{\""message\"":\""$(messageParam)\""}}"";  	// Define the template registration as JSON. 	JObject templates = new JObject(); 	templates[""genericMessage""] = new JObject 	{ 	  {""body"", templateBodyGCM } 	};   For more information, see [How to: Register push templates to send cross-platform notifications](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-service-mobile-dotnet-how-to-use-client-library/#how-to-register-push-templates-to-send-cross-platform-notifications). "
178,15,https://github.com/ggailey777/app-service-mobile-xamarin-android-quickstart-old,###Client-added push notification tags,36,ggailey777.app-service-mobile-xamarin-android-quickstart-old.md,3," When a mobile app registers for push notifications using an Azure App Service Mobile Apps backend, there are two default tags that can get added to the registration in Azure Notification Hubs: the installation ID, which is unique to the app on a given device, and the user ID, which is only added when the user has been previously authenticated. Any other tags that get supplied by the client are ignored, which is by design. (Note that this differs from Mobile Services, where the client could supply any tag and there were hooks into the registration process on the backend to validate tags on incoming registrations.)  Because the client can’t add tags and at the same time there is not service-side hooks into the push notification registration process, the client needs to do the work of adding new tags to a given registration. In this sample, an `/updatetags` endpoint in the backend lets the client add tags to their push registration. The client calls that endpoint to create new tags, as you can see in the following:  	try 	{ 	    // Define two new tags as a JSON array. 	    var body = new JArray(); 	    body.Add(""broadcast""); 	    body.Add(""test"");  	    // Call the custom API '/api/updatetags/<installationid>' 	    // with the JArray of tags. 	    var response = await client 	        .InvokeApiAsync(""updatetags/"" 	        + client.InstallationId, body); 	} 	catch (MobileServiceInvalidOperationException ex) 	{ 	    System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine( 	        string.Format(""Error with Azure push registration: {0}"", ex.Message)); 	}  For more information, see [Adding push notification tags from an Azure Mobile Apps client](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/writingdata_services/archive/2016/01/22/adding-push-notification-tags-from-an-azure-mobile-apps-client.aspx). "
179,15,https://github.com/ggailey777/app-service-mobile-xamarin-android-quickstart-old,###Authenticate first,3,ggailey777.app-service-mobile-xamarin-android-quickstart-old.md,3,"This sample is a little different from the tutorials in that push notifications are send to all devices with push registrations that belong to a specific user. When an authenticated user registers for push notifications, a tag with the user ID is automatically added. Because of this, it's important to have the user sign-in before registering for push notifications. You should also have the user sign-in before executing any data or sync requests, which will result in an exception when the endpoint requires authentication. You also probably don't want an unauthenticated user to see offline data stored on the device. The following button event handler shows how to require explicit user sign-in before push registration and doing the initial data sync:  	[Java.Interop.Export()] 	public async void LoginUser(View view) 	{ 	    // Only register for push notifications and load data after authentication succeeds. 	    if (await Authenticate()) 	    {             // Register the app for push notifications.             GcmClient.Register(this, ToDoBroadcastReceiver.senderIDs);  	        //Hide the button after authentication succeeds. 	        FindViewById<Button>(Resource.Id.buttonLoginUser).Visibility = ViewStates.Gone;              // Load the data.             OnRefreshItemsSelected();         } 	}  "

182,16,https://github.com/samuelbohler/apache2-chef-cookbook,## Ohai and Chef:,3,samuelbohler.apache2-chef-cookbook.md,2," * Ohai: 0.6.12+ * Chef: 0.10.10+  As of v1.2.0, this cookbook makes use of `node['platform_family']` to simplify platform selection logic. This attribute was introduced in Ohai v0.6.12. The recipe methods were introduced in Chef v0.10.10. If you must run an older version of Chef or Ohai, use [version 1.1.16 of this cookbook](https://supermarket.getchef.com/cookbooks/apache2/versions/1.1.16). "
183,16,https://github.com/samuelbohler/apache2-chef-cookbook,## Cookbooks:,36,samuelbohler.apache2-chef-cookbook.md,2," This cookbook doesn't have direct dependencies on other cookbooks, as none are needed for the default recipe or the general use cases.  Depending on your OS configuration and security policy, you may need additional recipes or cookbooks for this cookbook's recipes to converge on the node. In particular, the following Operating System settings may affect the behavior of this cookbook:  * apt cache outdated * SELinux enabled * IPtables * Compile tools * 3rd party repositories  On Ubuntu/Debian, use Opscode's `apt` cookbook to ensure the package cache is updated so Chef can install packages, or consider putting apt-get in your bootstrap process or [knife bootstrap template](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Knife+Bootstrap).  On RHEL, SELinux is enabled by default. The `selinux` cookbook contains a `permissive` recipe that can be used to set SELinux to ""Permissive"" state. Otherwise, additional recipes need to be created by the user to address SELinux permissions.  The easiest but **certainly not ideal way** to deal with IPtables is to flush all rules. Opscode does provide an `iptables` cookbook but is migrating from the approach used there to a more robust solution utilizing a general ""firewall"" LWRP that would have an ""iptables"" provider. Alternately, you can use ufw, with Opscode's `ufw` and `firewall` cookbooks to set up rules. See those cookbooks' READMEs for documentation.  Build/compile tools may not be installed on the system by default. Some recipes (e.g., `apache2::mod_auth_openid`) build the module from source. Use Opscode's `build-essential` cookbook to get essential build packages installed.  On ArchLinux, if you are using the `apache2::mod_auth_openid` recipe, you also need the `pacman` cookbook for the `pacman_aur` LWRP. Put `recipe[pacman]` on the node's expanded run list (on the node or in a role). This is not an explicit dependency because it is only required for this single recipe and platform; the pacman default recipe performs `pacman -Sy` to keep pacman's package cache updated.  The `apache2::god_monitor` recipe uses a definition from the `god` cookbook. Include `recipe[god]` in the node's expanded run list to ensure that the cookbook is available to the node, and to set up `god`. "

Additional   commentary on the   [original pull request](https://github.com/viverae-cookbooks/apache2/pull/15#commitcomment-1605406). "
196,16,https://github.com/samuelbohler/apache2-chef-cookbook,# Recipes,36,samuelbohler.apache2-chef-cookbook.md,1,"=======  Most of the recipes in the cookbook are for enabling Apache modules. Where additional configuration or behavior is used, it is documented below in more detail.  The following recipes merely enable the specified module: `mod_alias`, `mod_auth_basic`, `mod_auth_digest`, `mod_authn_file`, `mod_authnz_ldap`, `mod_authz_default`, `mod_authz_groupfile`, `mod_authz_host`, `mod_authz_user`, `mod_autoindex`, `mod_cgi`, `mod_dav_fs`, `mod_dav_svn`, `mod_deflate`, `mod_dir`, `mod_env`, `mod_expires`, `mod_headers`, `mod_ldap`, `mod_log_config`, `mod_mime`, `mod_negotiation`, `mod_proxy`, `mod_proxy_ajp`, `mod_proxy_balancer`, `mod_proxy_connect`, `mod_proxy_http`, `mod_python`, `mod_rewrite`, `mod_setenvif`, `mod_status`, `mod_wsgi`, `mod_xsendfile`.  On RHEL Family distributions, certain modules ship with a config file with the package. The recipes here may delete those configuration files to ensure they don't conflict with the settings from the cookbook, which will use per-module configuration in `/etc/httpd/mods-enabled`. "
197,16,https://github.com/samuelbohler/apache2-chef-cookbook,## default,3,samuelbohler.apache2-chef-cookbook.md,2,-------  The default recipe does a number of things to set up Apache HTTPd. It also includes a number of modules based on the attribute `node['apache']['default_modules']` as recipes. 
198,16,https://github.com/samuelbohler/apache2-chef-cookbook,## logrotate,3,samuelbohler.apache2-chef-cookbook.md,2,---------  Logrotate adds a logrotate entry for your apache2 logs. This recipe requires the `logrotate` cookbook; ensure that `recipe[logrotate]` is in the node's expanded run list. 
199,16,https://github.com/samuelbohler/apache2-chef-cookbook,## mod\_auth\_cas,36,samuelbohler.apache2-chef-cookbook.md,2,"--------------  This recipe installs the proper package and enables the `auth_cas` module. It can install from source or package. Package is the default, set the attribute `node['apache']['mod_auth_cas']['from_source']` to true to enable source installation. Modify the version to install by changing the attribute `node['apache']['mod_auth_cas']['source_revision']`. It is a version tag by default, but could be master, or another tag, or branch.  The module configuration is written out with the `CASCookiePath` set, otherwise an error loading the module may cause Apache to not start.  **Note**: This recipe does not work on EL 6 platforms unless epel-testing repository is enabled (outside the scope of this cookbook), or the package version 1.0.8.1-3.el6 or higher is otherwise available to the system due to this bug:  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?format=multiple&id=708550 "
200,16,https://github.com/samuelbohler/apache2-chef-cookbook,## mod\_auth\_openid,36,samuelbohler.apache2-chef-cookbook.md,2,"-----------------  **Changed via COOK-915**  This recipe compiles the module from source. In addition to `build-essential`, some other packages are included for installation like the GNU C++ compiler and development headers.  To use the module in your own cookbooks to authenticate systems using OpenIDs, specify an array of OpenIDs that are allowed to authenticate with the attribute `node['apache']['allowed_openids']`. Use the following in a vhost to protect with OpenID authentication:      AuthType OpenID require user <%= node['apache']['allowed_openids'].join(' ') %>     AuthOpenIDDBLocation <%= node['apache']['mod_auth_openid']['dblocation'] %>  Change the DBLocation with the attribute as required; this file is in a different location than previous versions, see below. It should be a sane default for most platforms, though, see `attributes/mod_auth_openid.rb`. "
201,16,https://github.com/samuelbohler/apache2-chef-cookbook,### Changes from COOK-915:,3,samuelbohler.apache2-chef-cookbook.md,3," * `AuthType OpenID` instead of `AuthOpenIDEnabled On`. * `require user` instead of `AuthOpenIDUserProgram`. * A bug(?) in `mod_auth_openid` causes it to segfault when attempting   to update the database file if the containing directory is not   writable by the HTTPD process owner (e.g., www-data), even if the   file is writable. In order to not interfere with other settings from   the default recipe in this cookbook, the db file is moved. "
202,16,https://github.com/samuelbohler/apache2-chef-cookbook,## mod\_fastcgi,3,samuelbohler.apache2-chef-cookbook.md,2,------------  Install the fastcgi package and enable the module.  Only work on Debian/Ubuntu 
203,16,https://github.com/samuelbohler/apache2-chef-cookbook,## mod\_fcgid,3,samuelbohler.apache2-chef-cookbook.md,2,"----------  Installs the fcgi package and enables the module. Requires EPEL on RHEL family.  On RHEL family, this recipe will delete the fcgid.conf and on version 6+, create the /var/run/httpd/mod_fcgid` directory, which prevents the emergency error:      [emerg] (2)No such file or directory: mod_fcgid: Can't create shared memory for size XX bytes "
204,16,https://github.com/samuelbohler/apache2-chef-cookbook,## mod\_php5,3,samuelbohler.apache2-chef-cookbook.md,2,"--------  Simply installs the appropriate package on Debian, Ubuntu and ArchLinux.  On Red Hat family distributions including Fedora, the php.conf that comes with the package is removed. On RHEL platforms less than v6, the `php53` package is used. "
205,16,https://github.com/samuelbohler/apache2-chef-cookbook,## mod\_ssl,3,samuelbohler.apache2-chef-cookbook.md,2,"--------  Besides installing and enabling `mod_ssl`, this recipe will append port 443 to the `node['apache']['listen_ports']` attribute array and update the ports.conf. "
206,16,https://github.com/samuelbohler/apache2-chef-cookbook,## god\_monitor,36,samuelbohler.apache2-chef-cookbook.md,2,"------------  Sets up a `god` monitor for Apache. External requirements are the `god` and `runit` cookbooks from Opscode. When using this recipe, include `recipe[god]` in the node's expanded run list to ensure the client downloads it; `god` depends on runit so that will also be downloaded.  **Note** This recipe is not tested under test-kitchen yet and is   pending fix in COOK-744. "
207,16,https://github.com/samuelbohler/apache2-chef-cookbook,# Definitions,6,samuelbohler.apache2-chef-cookbook.md,1,===========  The cookbook provides a few definitions. At some point in the future these definitions may be refactored into lightweight resources and providers as suggested by [foodcritic rule FC015](http://acrmp.github.com/foodcritic/#FC015). 
208,16,https://github.com/samuelbohler/apache2-chef-cookbook,## apache\_config,3,samuelbohler.apache2-chef-cookbook.md,2,"------------  Sets up configuration file for Apache from a template. The template should be in the same cookbook where the definition is used. This is used by the `apache_conf` definition and is not often used directly.  It will use `a2enconf` and `a2disconf` to control the symlinking of configuration files between `conf-available` and `conf-enabled`.  Enable or disable an Apache config file in `#{node['apache']['dir']}/conf-available` by calling `a2enmod` or `a2dismod` to manage the symbolic link in `#{node['apache']['dir']}/conf-enabled`. These config files should be created in your cookbook, and placed on the system using `apache_conf` "
209,16,https://github.com/samuelbohler/apache2-chef-cookbook,### Parameters:,3,samuelbohler.apache2-chef-cookbook.md,3," * `name` - Name of the config enabled or disabled with the `a2enconf` or `a2disconf` scripts. * `source`  - The location of a template file. The default `name.erb`. * `cookbook` - The cookbook in which the configuration template is located (if it is not located in the current cookbook). The default value is the current cookbook. * `enable` - Default true, which uses `a2enconf` to enable the config. If false, the config will be disabled with `a2disconf`. "
210,16,https://github.com/samuelbohler/apache2-chef-cookbook,### Examples:,6,samuelbohler.apache2-chef-cookbook.md,3, Enable the example config.  ``````     apache_config 'example' do       enable true     end ``````  Disable a module:  ``````     apache_config 'disabled_example' do       enable false     end ``````  See the recipes directory for many more examples of `apache_config`.

214,16,https://github.com/samuelbohler/apache2-chef-cookbook,## apache\_mod,3,samuelbohler.apache2-chef-cookbook.md,2,------------  Sets up configuration file for an Apache module from a template. The template should be in the same cookbook where the definition is used. This is used by the `apache_module` definition and is not often used directly.  This will use a template resource to write the module's configuration file in the `mods-available` under the Apache configuration directory (`node['apache']['dir']`). This is a platform-dependent location. See __apache\_module__. 
215,16,https://github.com/samuelbohler/apache2-chef-cookbook,### Parameters:,3,samuelbohler.apache2-chef-cookbook.md,3," * `name` - Name of the template. When used from the `apache_module`,   it will use the same name as the module. "

Not typically needed, defaults to `#{name}_module` * `enable` - Default true, which uses `a2enmod` to enable the module. If false, the module will be disabled with `a2dismod`. * `conf` - Default false. Set to true if the module has a config file, which will use `apache_mod` for the file. * `filename` - specify the full name of the file, e.g. "
219,16,https://github.com/samuelbohler/apache2-chef-cookbook,### Examples:,6,samuelbohler.apache2-chef-cookbook.md,3," Enable the ssl module, which also has a configuration template in `templates/default/mods/ssl.conf.erb`.  ``````     apache_module ""ssl"" do       conf true     end ``````  Enable the php5 module, which has a different filename than the module default:  ``````     apache_module ""php5"" do       filename ""libphp5.so""     end ``````  Disable a module:  ``````     apache_module ""disabled_module"" do       enable false     end ``````  See the recipes directory for many more examples of `apache_module`.

220,16,https://github.com/samuelbohler/apache2-chef-cookbook,## apache\_site,36,samuelbohler.apache2-chef-cookbook.md,2,"------------  Enable or disable a VirtualHost in `#{node['apache']['dir']}/sites-available` by calling a2ensite or a2dissite to manage the symbolic link in `#{node['apache']['dir']}/sites-enabled`.  The template for the site must be managed as a separate resource. To combine the template with enabling a site, see `web_app`. "
221,16,https://github.com/samuelbohler/apache2-chef-cookbook,### Parameters:,3,samuelbohler.apache2-chef-cookbook.md,3," * `name` - Name of the site. * `enable` - Default true, which uses `a2ensite` to enable the site. If false, the site will be disabled with `a2dissite`. "
222,16,https://github.com/samuelbohler/apache2-chef-cookbook,## web\_app,3,samuelbohler.apache2-chef-cookbook.md,2,"--------  Manage a template resource for a VirtualHost site, and enable it with `apache_site`. This is commonly done for managing web applications such as Ruby on Rails, PHP or Django, and the default behavior reflects that. However it is flexible.  This definition includes some recipes to make sure the system is configured to have Apache and some sane default modules:  * `apache2` * `apache2::mod_rewrite` * `apache2::mod_deflate` * `apache2::mod_headers`  It will then configure the template (see __Parameters__ and __Examples__ below), and enable or disable the site per the `enable` parameter. "
223,16,https://github.com/samuelbohler/apache2-chef-cookbook,### Parameters:,3,samuelbohler.apache2-chef-cookbook.md,3," Current parameters used by the definition:  * `name` - The name of the site. The template will be written to   `#{node['apache']['dir']}/sites-available/#{params['name']}.conf` * `cookbook` - Optional. Cookbook where the source template is. If   this is not defined, Chef will use the named template in the   cookbook where the definition is used. * `template` - Default `web_app.conf.erb`, source template file. * `enable` - Default true. Passed to the `apache_site` definition.  Additional parameters can be defined when the definition is called in a recipe, see __Examples__. "
224,16,https://github.com/samuelbohler/apache2-chef-cookbook,### Examples:,36,samuelbohler.apache2-chef-cookbook.md,3," The recommended way to use the `web_app` definition is in a application specific cookbook named ""my_app"". The following example would look for a template named 'web_app.conf.erb' in your cookbook containing the apache httpd directives defining the `VirtualHost` that would serve up ""my_app"".  ``````     web_app ""my_app"" do        template 'web_app.conf.erb'        server_name node['my_app']['hostname']     end ``````  All parameters are passed into the template. You can use whatever you like. The apache2 cookbook comes with a `web_app.conf.erb` template as an example. The following parameters are used in the template:  * `server_name` - ServerName directive. * `server_aliases` - ServerAlias directive. Must be an array of aliases. * `docroot` - DocumentRoot directive. * `application_name` - Used in RewriteLog directive. Will be set to the `name` parameter. * `directory_index` - Allow overriding the default DirectoryIndex setting, optional * `directory_options` - Override Options on the docroot, for example to add parameters like Includes or Indexes, optional. * `allow_override` - Modify the AllowOverride directive on the docroot to support apps that need .htaccess to modify configuration or require authentication.  To use the default web_app, for example:  ``````     web_app ""my_site"" do       server_name node['hostname']       server_aliases [node['fqdn'], ""my-site.example.com""]       docroot ""/srv/www/my_site""       cookbook 'apache2'     end ``````  The parameters specified will be used as:  * `@params[:server_name]` * `@params[:server_aliases]` * `@params[:docroot]`  In the template. When you write your own, the `@` is significant.  For more information about Definitions and parameters, see the [Chef Wiki](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Definitions) "
225,16,https://github.com/samuelbohler/apache2-chef-cookbook,# Usage,3,samuelbohler.apache2-chef-cookbook.md,1,"=====  Using this cookbook is relatively straightforward. Add the desired recipes to the run list of a node, or create a role. Depending on your environment, you may have multiple roles that use different recipes from this cookbook. Adjust any attributes as desired. For example, to create a basic role for web servers that provide both HTTP and HTTPS:  ``````     % cat roles/webserver.rb     name ""webserver""     description ""Systems that serve HTTP and HTTPS""     run_list(       ""recipe[apache2]"",       ""recipe[apache2::mod_ssl]""     )     default_attributes(       ""apache"" => {         ""listen_ports"" => [""80"", ""443""]       }     ) ``````  For examples of using the definitions in your own recipes, see their respective sections above.

242,18,https://github.com/Archerpe/HanLP,###方式一、Maven,-,Archerpe.HanLP.md,3, 为了方便用户，特提供内置了数据包的Portable版，只需在pom.xml加入：  ``` <dependency>     <groupId>com.hankcs</groupId>     <artifactId>hanlp</artifactId>     <version>portable-1.3.1</version> </dependency> ```  零配置，即可使用基本功能（除CRF分词、依存句法分析外的全部功能）。如果用户有自定义的需求，可以参考方式二，使用hanlp.properties进行配置。 
243,18,https://github.com/Archerpe/HanLP,###方式二、下载jar、data、hanlp.properties,-,Archerpe.HanLP.md,3, **HanLP**将数据与程序分离，给予用户自定义的自由。 
244,18,https://github.com/Archerpe/HanLP,#### 1、下载jar,-,Archerpe.HanLP.md,4, [hanlp.jar](https://github.com/hankcs/HanLP/releases)

246,18,https://github.com/Archerpe/HanLP,#### 3、配置文件,-,Archerpe.HanLP.md,4,示例配置文件:[hanlp.properties](https://github.com/hankcs/HanLP/releases) 在GitHub的发布页中，```hanlp.properties```一般和```jar```打包在同一个```zip```包中。  配置文件的作用是告诉HanLP数据包的位置，只需修改第一行      root=usr/home/HanLP/  为data的**父目录**即可，比如data目录是`/Users/hankcs/Documents/data`，那么`root=/Users/hankcs/Documents/` 。  - 如果选用mini词典的话，则需要修改配置文件： ``` CoreDictionaryPath=data/dictionary/CoreNatureDictionary.mini.txt BiGramDictionaryPath=data/dictionary/CoreNatureDictionary.ngram.mini.txt ```  最后将HanLP.properties放入classpath即可，对于任何项目，都可以放到src或resources目录下，编译时IDE会自动将其复制到classpath中。  如果放置不当，HanLP会智能提示当前环境下的合适路径，并且尝试从项目根目录读取数据集。 
247,18,https://github.com/Archerpe/HanLP,## 调用方法,-,Archerpe.HanLP.md,2, **HanLP**几乎所有的功能都可以通过工具类`HanLP`快捷调用，当你想不起来调用方法时，只需键入`HanLP.`，IDE应当会给出提示，并展示**HanLP**完善的文档。  *推荐用户始终通过工具类`HanLP`调用，这么做的好处是，将来**HanLP**升级后，用户无需修改调用代码。*  所有Demo都位于[com.hankcs.demo](https://github.com/hankcs/HanLP/tree/master/src/test/java/com/hankcs/demo)下，比文档覆盖了更多细节，强烈建议运行一遍。

269,18,https://github.com/Archerpe/HanLP,## 词典说明,-,Archerpe.HanLP.md,2,本章详细介绍**HanLP**中的词典格式，满足用户自定义的需要。**HanLP**中有许多词典，它们的格式都是相似的，形式都是文本文档，随时可以修改。
270,18,https://github.com/Archerpe/HanLP,### 基本格式,-,Archerpe.HanLP.md,3,词典分为词频词性词典和词频词典。  - 词频词性词典    * 每一行代表一个单词，格式遵从`[单词] [词性A] [A的频次] [词性B] [B的频次] ...`。 - 词频词典   * 每一行代表一个单词，格式遵从`[单词] [单词的频次]`。   * 每一行的分隔符为空格符或制表符  少数词典有自己的专用格式，比如同义词词典兼容《同义词词林扩展版》的文本格式，而转移矩阵词典则是一个csv表格。  下文主要介绍通用词典，如不注明，词典特指通用词典。 
271,18,https://github.com/Archerpe/HanLP,### 数据结构,-,Archerpe.HanLP.md,3, Trie树（字典树）是**HanLP**中使用最多的数据结构，为此，我实现了通用的Trie树，支持泛型、遍历、储存、载入。  用户自定义词典采用AhoCorasickDoubleArrayTrie和二分Trie树储存，其他词典采用基于[双数组Trie树(DoubleArrayTrie)](http://www.hankcs.com/program/java/%E5%8F%8C%E6%95%B0%E7%BB%84trie%E6%A0%91doublearraytriejava%E5%AE%9E%E7%8E%B0.html)实现的[AC自动机AhoCorasickDoubleArrayTrie](http://www.hankcs.com/program/algorithm/aho-corasick-double-array-trie.html)。 
272,18,https://github.com/Archerpe/HanLP,### 储存形式,-,Archerpe.HanLP.md,3, 词典有两个形态：文本文件(filename.txt)和缓存文件(filename.txt.bin或filename.txt.trie.dat和filename.txt.trie.value)。  - 文本文件   * 采用明文储存，UTF-8编码，CRLF换行符。 - 缓存文件   * 就是一些二进制文件，通常在文本文件的文件名后面加上.bin表示。有时候是.trie.dat和.trie.value。后者是历史遗留产物，分别代表trie树的数组和值。   * 如果你修改了任何词典，只有删除缓存才能生效。 
273,18,https://github.com/Archerpe/HanLP,### 修改方法,-,Archerpe.HanLP.md,3, HanLP的核心词典训练自人民日报2014语料，语料不是完美的，总会存在一些错误。这些错误可能会导致分词出现奇怪的结果，这时请打开调试模式排查问题： ```java HanLP.Config.enableDebug(); ``` - 核心词性词频词典   * 比如你在`data/dictionary/CoreNatureDictionary.txt`中发现了一个不是词的词，或者词性标注得明显不对，那么你可以修改它，然后删除缓存文件使其生效。   * 目前`CoreNatureDictionary.ngram.txt`的缓存依赖于`CoreNatureDictionary.txt`的缓存，修改了后者之后必须同步删除前者的缓存，否则可能出错 - 核心二元文法词典   * 二元文法词典`data/dictionary/CoreNatureDictionary.ngram.txt`储存的是两个词的接续，如果你发现不可能存在这种接续时，删掉即可。   * 你也可以添加你认为合理的接续，但是这两个词必须同时在核心词典中才会生效。 - 命名实体识别词典   * 基于角色标注的命名实体识别比较依赖词典，所以词典的质量大幅影响识别质量。   * 这些词典的格式与原理都是类似的，请阅读[相应的文章](http://www.hankcs.com/category/nlp/ner/)或代码修改它。  如果问题解决了，欢迎向我提交一个pull request，这是我在代码库中保留明文词典的原因，众人拾柴火焰高！

The major version number of Current releases will increment every 6 months   allowing for breaking changes to be introduced. This happens in April and   October every year. Current release lines beginning in October each year have   a maximum support life of 8 months. Current release lines beginning in April   each year will convert to LTS (see below) after 6 months and receive further   support for 30 months. * **LTS**: Releases that receive Long-term Support, with a focus on stability   and security. Every second Current release line (major version) will become an   LTS line and receive 18 months of _Active LTS_ support and a further 12   months of _Maintenance_. LTS release lines are given alphabetically   ordered codenames, beginning with v4 Argon. LTS releases are less frequent   and will attempt to maintain consistent major and minor version numbers,   only incrementing patch version numbers. There are no breaking changes or   feature additions, except in some special circumstances. More information   can be found in the [LTS README](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS/). * **Nightly**: Versions of code in this repository on the current Current   branch, automatically built every 24-hours where changes exist. Use with   caution. "
286,20,https://github.com/praveenjk/node,## Download,3,praveenjk.node.md,2," Binaries, installers, and source tarballs are available at <https://nodejs.org>.  **Current** and **LTS** releases are available at <https://nodejs.org/download/release/>, listed under their version strings. The [latest](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest/) directory is an alias for the latest Current release. The latest LTS release from an LTS line is available in the form: latest-_codename_. For example: <https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-argon>  **Nightly** builds are available at <https://nodejs.org/download/nightly/>, listed under their version string which includes their date (in UTC time) and the commit SHA at the HEAD of the release.  **API documentation** is available in each release and nightly directory under _docs_. <https://nodejs.org/api/> points to the API documentation of the latest stable version. "
287,20,https://github.com/praveenjk/node,### Verifying Binaries,3,praveenjk.node.md,3," Current, LTS and Nightly download directories all contain a _SHASUM256.txt_ file that lists the SHA checksums for each file available for download.  The _SHASUM256.txt_ can be downloaded using curl.  ```console $ curl -O https://nodejs.org/dist/vx.y.z/SHASUMS256.txt ```  To check that a downloaded file matches the checksum, run it through `sha256sum` with a command such as:  ```console $ grep node-vx.y.z.tar.gz SHASUMS256.txt | sha256sum -c - ```  _(Where ""node-vx.y.z.tar.gz"" is the name of the file you have downloaded)_  Additionally, Current and LTS releases (not Nightlies) have GPG signed copies of SHASUM256.txt files available as SHASUM256.txt.asc. You can use `gpg` to verify that the file has not been tampered with.  To verify a SHASUM256.txt.asc, you will first need to import all of the GPG keys of individuals authorized to create releases. They are listed at the bottom of this README under [Release Team](#release-team). Use a command such as this to import the keys:  ```console $ gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys DD8F2338BAE7501E3DD5AC78C273792F7D83545D ```  _(See the bottom of this README for a full script to import active release keys)_  You can then use `gpg --verify SHASUMS256.txt.asc` to verify that the file has been signed by an authorized member of the Node.js team.  Once verified, use the SHASUMS256.txt.asc file to get the checksum for the binary verification command above. "
288,20,https://github.com/praveenjk/node,## Building Node.js,3,praveenjk.node.md,2, See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for instructions on how to build Node.js from source. 
289,20,https://github.com/praveenjk/node,## Security,6,praveenjk.node.md,2," All security bugs in Node.js are taken seriously and should be reported by emailing security@nodejs.org. This will be delivered to a subset of the project team who handle security issues. Please don't disclose security bugs publicly until they have been handled by the security team.  Your email will be acknowledged within 24 hours, and you’ll receive a more detailed response to your email within 48 hours indicating the next steps in handling your report. "
290,20,https://github.com/praveenjk/node,## Current Project Team Members,5,praveenjk.node.md,2," The Node.js project team comprises a group of core collaborators and a sub-group that forms the _Core Technical Committee_ (CTC) which governs the project.

312,23,https://github.com/hyndex/animate.css,##Basic Usage,3,hyndex.animate.css.md,2,"1. Include the stylesheet on your document's `<head>`    ```html   <head>     <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""animate.min.css"">   </head>   ```   or use the version hosted by [CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/animate.css)   ```html   <head>     <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animate.css/3.5.2/animate.min.css"">   </head>   ``` 2. Add the class `animated` to the element you want to animate.  You may also want to include the class `infinite` for an infinite loop.  3. Finally you need to add one of the following classes:    * `bounce`   * `flash`   * `pulse`   * `rubberBand`   * `shake`   * `headShake`   * `swing`   * `tada`   * `wobble`   * `jello`   * `bounceIn`   * `bounceInDown`   * `bounceInLeft`   * `bounceInRight`   * `bounceInUp`   * `bounceOut`   * `bounceOutDown`   * `bounceOutLeft`   * `bounceOutRight`   * `bounceOutUp`   * `fadeIn`   * `fadeInDown`   * `fadeInDownBig`   * `fadeInLeft`   * `fadeInLeftBig`   * `fadeInRight`   * `fadeInRightBig`   * `fadeInUp`   * `fadeInUpBig`   * `fadeOut`   * `fadeOutDown`   * `fadeOutDownBig`   * `fadeOutLeft`   * `fadeOutLeftBig`   * `fadeOutRight`   * `fadeOutRightBig`   * `fadeOutUp`   * `fadeOutUpBig`   * `flipInX`   * `flipInY`   * `flipOutX`   * `flipOutY`   * `lightSpeedIn`   * `lightSpeedOut`   * `rotateIn`   * `rotateInDownLeft`   * `rotateInDownRight`   * `rotateInUpLeft`   * `rotateInUpRight`   * `rotateOut`   * `rotateOutDownLeft`   * `rotateOutDownRight`   * `rotateOutUpLeft`   * `rotateOutUpRight`   * `hinge`   * `jackInTheBox`   * `rollIn`   * `rollOut`   * `zoomIn`   * `zoomInDown`   * `zoomInLeft`   * `zoomInRight`   * `zoomInUp`   * `zoomOut`   * `zoomOutDown`   * `zoomOutLeft`   * `zoomOutRight`   * `zoomOutUp`   * `slideInDown`   * `slideInLeft`   * `slideInRight`   * `slideInUp`   * `slideOutDown`   * `slideOutLeft`   * `slideOutRight`   * `slideOutUp`  Full example: ```html <h1 class=""animated infinite bounce"">Example</h1> ```  [Check out all the animations here!](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) "
313,23,https://github.com/hyndex/animate.css,##Usage,3,hyndex.animate.css.md,2,"To use animate.css in your website, simply drop the stylesheet into your document's `<head>`, and add the class `animated` to an element, along with any of the animation names. That's it! You've got a CSS animated element. Super!  ```html <head>   <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""animate.min.css""> </head> ``` or use the version hosted by [CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/animate.css) ```html <head>   <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animate.css/3.5.2/animate.min.css""> </head> ```  You can do a whole bunch of other stuff with animate.css when you combine it with jQuery or add your own CSS rules. Dynamically add animations using jQuery with ease:  ```javascript $('#yourElement').addClass('animated bounceOutLeft'); ```  You can also detect when an animation ends:  <!-- Before you make changes to this file, you should know that $('#yourElement').one() is *NOT A TYPO*  http://api.jquery.com/one/ -->  ```javascript $('#yourElement').one('webkitAnimationEnd mozAnimationEnd MSAnimationEnd oanimationend animationend', doSomething); ```  [View a video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBQGl6zokMs) on how to use Animate.css with jQuery here.  **Note:** `jQuery.one()` is used when you want to execute the event handler at most *once*. More information [here](http://api.jquery.com/one/).  You can also extend jQuery to add a function that does it all for you:  ```javascript $.fn.extend({     animateCss: function (animationName) {         var animationEnd = 'webkitAnimationEnd mozAnimationEnd MSAnimationEnd oanimationend animationend';         this.addClass('animated ' + animationName).one(animationEnd, function() {             $(this).removeClass('animated ' + animationName);         });     } }); ```  And use it like this:  ```javascript $('#yourElement').animateCss('bounce'); ```  You can change the duration of your animations, add a delay or change the number of times that it plays:  ```css"
314,23,https://github.com/hyndex/animate.css,#yourElement {,8,hyndex.animate.css.md,1,"  -vendor-animation-duration: 3s;   -vendor-animation-delay: 2s;   -vendor-animation-iteration-count: infinite; } ```  *Note: be sure to replace ""vendor"" in the CSS with the applicable vendor prefixes (webkit, moz, etc)* "
315,23,https://github.com/hyndex/animate.css,## Custom Builds,3,hyndex.animate.css.md,2,"Animate.css is powered by [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/), and you can create custom builds pretty easily. First of all, you’ll need Gulp and all other dependencies:  ```sh $ cd path/to/animate.css/ $ sudo npm install ```  Next, run `gulp` to compile your custom builds. For example, if you want only some of the “attention seekers”, simply edit the `animate-config.json` file to select only the animations you want to use.  ```javascript ""attention_seekers"": {   ""bounce"": true,   ""flash"": false,   ""pulse"": false,   ""shake"": true,   ""headShake"": true,   ""swing"": true,   ""tada"": true,   ""wobble"": true,   ""jello"":true } ``` "

Typically you can use another computer than the one you have used to build your story to make sure everything is loading properly. Alternatively [this article](http://browsers.about.com/od/faq/tp/Incognito-Browsing.htm) will show you how to configure your browser for an incognito session or you can just sign-out from ArcGIS Online and any service that you have used to host your Journal's resources.  - Try the application on different browsers, screen resolutions and mobile devices.

331,25,https://github.com/owap/map-journal-storytelling-template-js,### Tips for your content,6,owap.map-journal-storytelling-template-js.md,3,
332,25,https://github.com/owap/map-journal-storytelling-template-js,#### Link between sections,6,owap.map-journal-storytelling-template-js.md,4,"One [popular](https://github.com/Esri/map-journal-storytelling-template-js/issues/5) [request](https://github.com/Esri/map-journal-storytelling-template-js/issues/7) is to add the ability to navigate between Journal's sections using links in the panel or through map features popup. Until we implement that capability in the builder you can do it using HTML markup.  To add links in a section content, use the `Source button` of the text editor (second from the right on the first line) and use the following markup:  ``` <p><a onclick=""require(['dojo/topic'], function(topic){ topic.publish('story-navigate-section', 0); });"">Navigate to home section</a></p> <p><a onclick=""require(['dojo/topic'], function(topic){ topic.publish('story-navigate-section', 2); });"">Navigate to section 2</a></p> <p><a onclick=""require(['dojo/topic'], function(topic){ topic.publish('story-navigate-section', 4); });"">Navigate to section 4</a></p> ```  Note that the links navigate the Journal using an index that start at 0 for the Home Section. If you remove or reorder your sections, you will have to modify the links manually.  You can also add that capability to map feature popups. This can for example allow the home section map to be the spatial index to your story. To do that you need to download the application and include a piece of code in `index.html`, look at the end of the file and modify it as below. Follow the instructions to configure the web map and the layer that will receive the click event.   ``` require([""dojo/topic""], function(topic) { 	/* 	 * Custom Javascript to be executed while the application is initializing goes here 	 */  	// The application is ready 	topic.subscribe(""tpl-ready"", function(){ 		/* 		 * Custom Javascript to be executed when the application is ready goes here 		 */ 	});  	/* 	 * Set up a click handler on the feature of the map to navigate the story 	 */  	// 	// ************************************* 	// Configure the webmap id and layer id 	// ************************************* 	// 	// First find the webmap id through the URL when you open the map in Map Viewer 	// To get the layer id, paste the webmap id below and open the application, 	//   then open the developer console, all the layers ids will be listed, 	//   find the correct one and paste it below 	// After this setup, clicking the 3rd feature of your layer, will navigate to the third entry 	// 	var WEBMAP_ID = ""0bb11c0469f042b3afaf8b0d76572822"", 		LAYER_ID = ""csv_7673_0"";  	var clickHandlerIsSetup = false;  	topic.subscribe(""story-loaded-map"", function(result){ 		if ( result.id == WEBMAP_ID && ! clickHandlerIsSetup ) { 			var map = app.maps[result.id].response.map, 				layer = map.getLayer(LAYER_ID);  			console.log(map.graphicsLayerIds);  			if ( layer ) { 				layer.on(""mouse-over"", function(e){ 					map.setMapCursor(""pointer""); 					map.infoWindow.setContent(""<b>""+e.graphic.attributes.name.split("","")[0]+""</b><br/><i>Click to zoom</i>""); 					map.infoWindow.show(e.graphic.geometry); 				});  				layer.on(""mouse-out"", function(e){ 					map.setMapCursor(""default""); 					map.infoWindow.hide(); 				});  				layer.on(""click"", function(e){ 					var index = e.graphic.attributes[""__OBJECTID""]; 					topic.publish(""story-navigate-section"", index); 				}); 			}  			clickHandlerIsSetup = true; 		} 	}); }); ``` "

334,25,https://github.com/owap/map-journal-storytelling-template-js,#### Can I keep my Journal private?,6,owap.map-journal-storytelling-template-js.md,4,"Yes, the regular ArcGIS Online security model applies. By default your Journal is private, you can share it through Map Journal builder or ArcGIS Online. When you share your Journal, it is your responsibility to make sure that all the resources of your Journal (webmaps, images, videos) are accessible to your audience. "
335,25,https://github.com/owap/map-journal-storytelling-template-js,#### Who can edit my Journal?,6,owap.map-journal-storytelling-template-js.md,4,A Journal can only be edited by its owner (the named account that initially created the Journal). Organization Administrator (does not apply for public account) can take or give the Journal's ownership to another user. In that case you won't anymore be able to edit the Journal. Changing the ownership is the only way to collaborate on a Journal creation without sharing the owner's credentials. 
336,25,https://github.com/owap/map-journal-storytelling-template-js,#### Can I use private web map or layer?,6,owap.map-journal-storytelling-template-js.md,4,"Yes.  When the Journal is hosted in ArcGIS Online or Portal for ArcGIS, users that don't have access to the Journal or a webmap used in the Journal will be redirected to the ArcGIS Online sign-in page. It is not possible to display an authentication dialog in the Map Journal when the Journal is hosted in ArcGIS Online.  When the Journal is hosted on your web server, an authentication dialog will appear inside the application.  Note that for that authentication to work on some older browser (Internet Explorer 9) you need to install a proxy server on your web server to make sure the login credentials can be passed securely to ArcGIS Online. For more information, see the [Using the proxy](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jshelp/ags_proxy.html) in the ArcGIS API for JavaScript documentation.  Because of that limitation, we recommend that you configure the application to use OAuth. OAuth 2.0 based authentication is available for ArcGIS Online and Portal for ArcGIS users with developer or organizational accounts. Follow the procedure to [add an application](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/share-maps/add-items.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_55703F1EE9C845C3B07BBD85221FB074) and [register an application](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/share-maps/add-items.htm#ESRI_SECTION2_20AF85308FD548B5ADBAE28836F66D3F) to get an OAuth application ID. Once you have that application, open `index.html`, locate the `configOptions` section and fill the `oAuthAppId` property.  If you are using secured services but don't want users to have to authenticate, you can use a proxy to store the username/password to be used, see [Working with Proxy Services](https://developers.arcgis.com/authentication/working-with-proxies/#selfhosted-proxy-service), and add a proxy rules to specify what services need to use the proxy by editing `PROXY_RULES` in `app/config.js`.

Then:  - Find your Portal `apps/MapJournal` folder (depending on your installation and version of Portal, this is either `C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Portal\apps\MapSeries` or `C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Portal\webapps\arcgis#home\webmap\templates\MapJournal`).  - Remove the content of that folder  - Extract the archive so that `index.html` is located at `MapJournal\index.html`  If Map Journal was already included in your Portal you are done (Portal for ArcGIS 10.3+).  If Map Journal was not available in your Portal:  - Log into Portal for ArcGIS and open My Content > Add Item > Application > Web Mapping Application > Configurable. Configure the URL to `https://portal.domain.com/arcgis/apps/MapJournal`. More details in the following documentation [publishing a new web application item](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/main/10.2/index.html#/Adding_applications/019300000031000000/).  - Create a new group that will reference the template available in your Portal  - Share the newly created item with that group  - Open My Organization > Edit Settings > Map  and set the `Web App Templates` to the newly created group. More details in the following documentation [configuring the web application gallery](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/main/10.2/index.html#/Configure_map_viewer/017s00000024000000/)  - Now when you share a web map, the template should be an option  _Note that the archive you downloaded is using the ArcGIS API for JavaScript hosted in ArcGIS Online. This can create some incompatibility with your Portal, if you run into issue, please see the next section to update it._  Also note that the web application gallery preview feature redirects to the StoryMaps website, the target page can be modified in `app/config.js > HELP_URL_PORTAL`.

On Windows this is Internet Information Services (IIS), if you have a `C:\inetpub\wwwroot` folder on your computer, you should be able to access it's content using `http://localhost`  * On Windows or Mac OS, use a simple web server like [Mongoose](https://code.google.com/p/mongoose/) (not recommended for production)  If you are experiencing some rendering issues like improper symbol appearing instead of icons, you will have an extra configuration to perform. Some servers require to configure a new mime type to be able to serve Map Journal fonts correctly.

It provides popular DL and RL modules that can be easily customized and assembled for tackling real-world machine learning problems.   TensorLayer grow out from a need to combine the power of TensorFlow with the right building modules for deep neural networks. According to our years of research and practical experiences of tackling real-world machine learning problems, we come up with three design goals for TensorLayer:  - **Simplicity**: We make TensorLayer easy to work with by providing mass tutorials that can be deployed and run through in minutes. A TensorFlow user may find it easier to bootstrap with the simple, high-level APIs provided by TensorLayer, and then deep dive into their implementation details if need. - **Flexibility**: Developing an effective DL algorithm for a specific domain typically requires careful tunings from many aspects. Without the loss of simplicity, TensorLayer allows users to customize their modules by manipulating the native APIs of TensorFlow (e.g., training parameters, iteration control and tensor components). - **Performance**: TensorLayer aims to provide zero-cost abstraction for TensorFlow. With its first-class support for TensorFlow, it can easily run on either heterogeneous platforms or multiple computation nodes without compromise in performance.  A frequent question regarding TensorLayer is that why do we develop a new library instead of leveraging existing ones like [Keras](https://github.com/fchollet/keras) and [Tflearn](https://github.com/tflearn/tflearn). TensorLayer differentiates with those with its pursuits for flexibility and performance. A DL user may find it comfortable to bootstrap with Keras and Tflearn. These libraries provide high-level abstractions and hide engine implementation details from users. Though good for using, it becomes hard to tune and modify from the bottom, which is necessary when addressing domain-specific problems (i.e., one model does not fit all). Nevertheless, flexibility does not always come with the loss of performance. TensorLayer allows seamless distributed and heterogeneous deployment with its first-class support for the TensorFlow runtime. "

To be able to use Ruru, make sure that your Ruby version is 2.3.0 or higher.  1. Your local MRI copy has to be built with the `--enable-shared` option. For    example, using rbenv:    ```bash   CONFIGURE_OPTS=--enable-shared rbenv install 2.3.0   ```  2. Add Ruru to `Cargo.toml`    ```toml   [dependencies]   ruru = ""0.9.0""   ```  3. Compile your library as a `dylib`    ```toml   [lib]   crate-type = [""dylib""]   ```  4. Create a function which will initialize the extension    ```rust,ignore   #[no_mangle]   pub extern fn initialize_my_app() {       Class::new(""SomeClass"");        // ... etc   }   ```  5. Build extension    ```bash   $ cargo build --release   ```    or using Thermite    ```bash   $ rake thermite:build   ```  6. On the ruby side, open the compiled `dylib` and call the function to initialize extension    ```ruby   require 'fiddle'    library = Fiddle::dlopen('path_to_dylib/libmy_library.dylib')    Fiddle::Function.new(library['initialize_my_app'], [], Fiddle::TYPE_VOIDP).call   ```  7.

You will need to use Git and a Bitbucket account to complete and submit the exercises.  It is expected that some applicants will have no previous experience with Git and/or Bitbucket. Successfully using these tools is part of the exercise.  Follow the instructions that were provided in the job posting for details on how to complete this exercise.

To complete this exercise, implement the incomplete methods defined in ""exercise.rb"", such that they pass the tests defined in ""exercise_spec.rb"".  In order to run the tests, you will need Minitest installed (if you're running Ruby 1.9 or newer, Minitest is already installed - otherwise, install it from Rubygems by running ```gem install minitest```).  To execute the test suite, run:      $ ruby exercise_spec.rb  The Exercise class is correctly implemented once the test suite returns:      4 tests, 8 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips"
414,29,https://github.com/voxik/fog,## Dependency Notice,3,voxik.fog.md,2,"![fog](http://geemus.s3.amazonaws.com/fog.png)  fog is the Ruby cloud services library, top to bottom:  * Collections provide a simplified interface, making clouds easier to work with and switch between. * Requests allow power users to get the most out of the features of each individual cloud. * Mocks make testing and integrating a breeze.  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/fog/fog.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/fog/fog) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/fog/fog.svg)](https://gemnasium.com/fog/fog) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/fog/fog/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/fog/fog) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/fog.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/fog)   Currently all fog providers are getting separated into metagems to lower the load time and dependency count.  If there's a metagem available for your cloud provider, e.g. `fog-aws`, you should be using it instead of requiring the full fog collection to avoid unnecessary dependencies.  'fog' should be required explicitly only if: - The provider you use doesn't yet have a metagem available. - You require Ruby 1.9.3 support. "
415,29,https://github.com/voxik/fog,## Getting Started,3,voxik.fog.md,2," The easiest way to learn fog is to install the gem and use the interactive console. Here is an example of wading through server creation for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud:  ``` $ sudo gem install fog [...]  $ fog    Welcome to fog interactive!   :default provides [...]  >> server = Compute[:aws].servers.create ArgumentError: image_id is required for this operation  >> server = Compute[:aws].servers.create(:image_id => 'ami-5ee70037') <Fog::AWS::EC2::Server [...]>  >> server.destroy # cleanup after yourself or regret it, trust me true ``` "
416,29,https://github.com/voxik/fog,## Ruby version,34,voxik.fog.md,2, Fog requires Ruby `2.0.0` or later.  Ruby `1.8` and `1.9` support was dropped in `fog-v2.0.0` as a backwards incompatible change. Please use the later fog `1.x` versions if you require `1.8.7` or `1.9.x` support. 
417,29,https://github.com/voxik/fog,## Collections,3,voxik.fog.md,2," A high level interface to each cloud is provided through collections, such as `images` and `servers`. You can see a list of available collections by calling `collections` on the connection object. You can try it out using the `fog` command:      >> Compute[:aws].collections     [:addresses, :directories, ..., :volumes, :zones]  Some collections are available across multiple providers:  * compute providers have `flavors`, `images` and `servers` * dns providers have `zones` and `records` * storage providers have `directories` and `files`  Collections share basic CRUD type operations, such as:  * `all` - fetch every object of that type from the provider. * `create` - initialize a new record locally and a remote resource with the provider. * `get` - fetch a single object by its identity from the provider. * `new` - initialize a new record locally, but do not create a remote resource with the provider.  As an example, we'll try initializing and persisting a Rackspace Cloud server:  ```ruby require 'fog'  compute = Fog::Compute.new(   :provider           => 'Rackspace',   :rackspace_api_key  => key,   :rackspace_username => username ) "
418,29,https://github.com/voxik/fog,"# boot a gentoo server (flavor 1 = 256, image 3 = gentoo 2008.0)",-,voxik.fog.md,1,"server = compute.servers.create(:flavor_id => 1, :image_id => 3, :name => 'my_server') server.wait_for { ready? } # give server time to boot "
419,29,https://github.com/voxik/fog,# DO STUFF,-,voxik.fog.md,1," server.destroy # cleanup after yourself or regret it, trust me ``` "
420,29,https://github.com/voxik/fog,## Models,3,voxik.fog.md,2," Many of the collection methods return individual objects, which also provide common methods:  * `destroy` - will destroy the persisted object from the provider * `save` - persist the object to the provider * `wait_for` - takes a block and waits for either the block to return true for the object or for a timeout (defaults to 10 minutes) "
421,29,https://github.com/voxik/fog,## Mocks,3,voxik.fog.md,2," As you might imagine, testing code using Fog can be slow and expensive, constantly turning on and shutting down instances. Mocking allows skipping this overhead by providing an in memory representation of resources as you make requests. Enabling mocking is easy to use: before you run other commands, simply run:  ```ruby Fog.mock! ```  Then proceed as usual, if you run into unimplemented mocks, fog will raise an error and as always contributions are welcome! "
422,29,https://github.com/voxik/fog,## Requests,3,voxik.fog.md,2," Requests allow you to dive deeper when the models just can't cut it. You can see a list of available requests by calling `#requests` on the connection object.  For instance, ec2 provides methods related to reserved instances that don't have any models (yet). Here is how you can lookup your reserved instances:      $ fog     >> Compute[:aws].describe_reserved_instances     #<Excon::Response [...]>  It will return an [excon](http://github.com/geemus/excon) response, which has `body`, `headers` and `status`. Both return nice hashes. "
423,29,https://github.com/voxik/fog,## Go forth and conquer,36,voxik.fog.md,2," Play around and use the console to explore or check out [fog.io](http://fog.io) and the [provider documentation](http://fog.io/about/provider_documentation.html) for more details and examples.

Semantic versioning is only guaranteed for the common API, not any provider-specific extensions.  You may also need to update your configuration from time to time (even between Fog releases) as providers update or deprecate services.  However, we still aim for forwards compatibility within Fog major versions.  As a result of this policy, you can (and should) specify a dependency on this gem using the [Pessimistic Version Constraint][pvc] with two digits of precision. For example:  ```ruby spec.add_dependency 'fog', '~> 1.0' ```  This means your project is compatible with Fog 1.0 up until 2.0.  You can also set a higher minimum version:  ```ruby spec.add_dependency 'fog', '~> 1.16' ```  [semver]: http://semver.org/ [pvc]: http://guides.rubygems.org/patterns/ "

If it's not, Rails will generate standard .yml files instead of factory files.  factory_girl takes an option `suffix: 'some_suffix'` to generate factories as `modelname_some_suffix.rb`.  If you use factory_girl for fixture replacement and already have a `factories.rb` file in the directory that contains your tests, factory_girl_rails will insert new factory definitions at the top of `factories.rb`.

A Delta is made up of an [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) of Operations, which describe changes to a document. They can be an [`insert`](#insert-operation), [`delete`](#delete-operation) or [`retain`](#retain-operation). Note operations do not take an index. They always describe the change at the current index. Use retains to ""keep"" or ""skip"" certain parts of the document.  Don’t be confused by its name Delta&mdash;Deltas represents both documents and changes to documents. If you think of Deltas as the instructions from going from one document to another, the way Deltas represent a document is by expressing the instructions starting from an empty document.  "

Additional information on the way Quill specifically uses Deltas can be found on its own [Delta docs](http://quilljs.com/docs/delta/). A walkthough of the motivation and design thinking behind Deltas are on [Designing the Delta Format](http://quilljs.com/guides/designing-the-delta-format/).  This format is suitable for [Operational Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation) and defines several functions to support this use case.  "

486,36,https://github.com/cwohlman/delta,### Insert Operation,3,cwohlman.delta.md,3," Insert operations have an `insert` key defined. A String value represents inserting text. Any other type represents inserting an embed (however only one level of object comparison will be performed for equality).  In both cases of text and embeds, an optional `attributes` key can be defined with an Object to describe additonal formatting information. Formats can be changed by the [retain](#retain) operation.  ```js // Insert a bolded ""Text"" { insert: ""Text"", attributes: { bold: true } }  // Insert a link { insert: ""Google"", attributes: { href: 'https://www.google.com' } }  // Insert an embed {   insert: { image: 'https://octodex.github.com/images/labtocat.png' },   attributes: { alt: ""Lab Octocat"" } }  // Insert another embed {   insert: { video: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMH0bHeiRNg' },   attributes: {     width: 420,     height: 315   } } ``` "
487,36,https://github.com/cwohlman/delta,### Delete Operation,3,cwohlman.delta.md,3, Delete operations have a Number `delete` key defined representing the number of characters to delete. All embeds have a length of 1.  ```js // Delete the next 10 characters { delete: 10 } ``` 
488,36,https://github.com/cwohlman/delta,### Retain Operation,3,cwohlman.delta.md,3," Retain operations have a Number `retain` key defined representing the number of characters to keep (other libraries might use the name keep or skip). An optional `attributes` key can be defined with an Object to describe formatting changes to the character range. A value of `null` in the `attributes` Object represents removal of that key.  *Note: It is not necessary to retain the last characters of a document as this is implied.*  ```js // Keep the next 5 characters { retain: 5 }  // Keep and bold the next 5 characters { retain: 5, attributes: { bold: true } }  // Keep and unbold the next 5 characters // More specifically, remove the bold key in the attributes Object // in the next 5 characters { retain: 5, attributes: { bold: null } } ```  "

Imagine a simple example in which you want to have a view fill its superview but inset by 10 pixels on every side ```obj-c UIView *superview = self;  UIView *view1 = [[UIView alloc] init]; view1.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = NO; view1.backgroundColor = [UIColor greenColor]; [superview addSubview:view1];  UIEdgeInsets padding = UIEdgeInsetsMake(10, 10, 10, 10);  [superview addConstraints:@[      //view1 constraints     [NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItem:view1                                  attribute:NSLayoutAttributeTop                                  relatedBy:NSLayoutRelationEqual                                     toItem:superview                                  attribute:NSLayoutAttributeTop                                 multiplier:1.0                                   constant:padding.top],      [NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItem:view1                                  attribute:NSLayoutAttributeLeft                                  relatedBy:NSLayoutRelationEqual                                     toItem:superview                                  attribute:NSLayoutAttributeLeft                                 multiplier:1.0                                   constant:padding.left],      [NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItem:view1                                  attribute:NSLayoutAttributeBottom                                  relatedBy:NSLayoutRelationEqual                                     toItem:superview                                  attribute:NSLayoutAttributeBottom                                 multiplier:1.0                                   constant:-padding.bottom],      [NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItem:view1                                  attribute:NSLayoutAttributeRight                                  relatedBy:NSLayoutRelationEqual                                     toItem:superview                                  attribute:NSLayoutAttributeRight                                 multiplier:1                                   constant:-padding.right],   ]]; ``` Even with such a simple example the code needed is quite verbose and quickly becomes unreadable when you have more than 2 or 3 views. Another option is to use Visual Format Language (VFL), which is a bit less long winded. However the ASCII type syntax has its own pitfalls and its also a bit harder to animate as `NSLayoutConstraint constraintsWithVisualFormat:` returns an array. "
583,37,https://github.com/xiky/Masonry,## Prepare to meet your Maker!,3,xiky.Masonry.md,2," Heres the same constraints created using MASConstraintMaker  ```obj-c UIEdgeInsets padding = UIEdgeInsetsMake(10, 10, 10, 10);  [view1 mas_makeConstraints:^(MASConstraintMaker *make) {     make.top.equalTo(superview.mas_top).with.offset(padding.top); //with is an optional semantic filler     make.left.equalTo(superview.mas_left).with.offset(padding.left);     make.bottom.equalTo(superview.mas_bottom).with.offset(-padding.bottom);     make.right.equalTo(superview.mas_right).with.offset(-padding.right); }]; ``` Or even shorter  ```obj-c [view1 mas_makeConstraints:^(MASConstraintMaker *make) {     make.edges.equalTo(superview).with.insets(padding); }]; ```  Also note in the first example we had to add the constraints to the superview `[superview addConstraints:...`. Masonry however will automagically add constraints to the appropriate view.  Masonry will also call `view1.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = NO;` for you. "

586,37,https://github.com/xiky/Masonry,#### 2. UIView/NSView,3,xiky.Masonry.md,4,-------------------------  |  -------------------------- view.mas_left              |  NSLayoutAttributeLeft view.mas_right             |  NSLayoutAttributeRight view.mas_top               |  NSLayoutAttributeTop view.mas_bottom            |  NSLayoutAttributeBottom view.mas_leading           |  NSLayoutAttributeLeading view.mas_trailing          |  NSLayoutAttributeTrailing view.mas_width             |  NSLayoutAttributeWidth view.mas_height            |  NSLayoutAttributeHeight view.mas_centerX           |  NSLayoutAttributeCenterX view.mas_centerY           |  NSLayoutAttributeCenterY view.mas_baseline          |  NSLayoutAttributeBaseline   if you want view.left to be greater than or equal to label.left : ```obj-c //these two constraints are exactly the same make.left.greaterThanOrEqualTo(label); make.left.greaterThanOrEqualTo(label.mas_left); ``` 
587,37,https://github.com/xiky/Masonry,#### 3. NSNumber,3,xiky.Masonry.md,4," Auto Layout allows width and height to be set to constant values. if you want to set view to have a minimum and maximum width you could pass a number to the equality blocks: ```obj-c //width >= 200 && width <= 400 make.width.greaterThanOrEqualTo(@200); make.width.lessThanOrEqualTo(@400) ```  However Auto Layout does not allow alignment attributes such as left, right, centerY etc to be set to constant values. So if you pass a NSNumber for these attributes Masonry will turn these into constraints relative to the view&rsquo;s superview ie: ```obj-c //creates view.left = view.superview.left + 10 make.left.lessThanOrEqualTo(@10) ```  Instead of using NSNumber, you can use primitives and structs to build your constraints, like so: ```obj-c make.top.mas_equalTo(42); make.height.mas_equalTo(20); make.size.mas_equalTo(CGSizeMake(50, 100)); make.edges.mas_equalTo(UIEdgeInsetsMake(10, 0, 10, 0)); make.left.mas_equalTo(view).mas_offset(UIEdgeInsetsMake(10, 0, 10, 0)); ```  By default, macros which support [autoboxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoboxing#Autoboxing) are prefixed with `mas_`. Unprefixed versions are available by defining `MAS_SHORTHAND_GLOBALS` before importing Masonry. "
588,37,https://github.com/xiky/Masonry,#### 4. NSArray,3,xiky.Masonry.md,4," An array of a mixture of any of the previous types ```obj-c make.height.equalTo(@[view1.mas_height, view2.mas_height]); make.height.equalTo(@[view1, view2]); make.left.equalTo(@[view1, @100, view3.right]); ```` "
589,37,https://github.com/xiky/Masonry,## Learn to prioritize,3,xiky.Masonry.md,2, > `.priority` allows you to specify an exact priority  > `.priorityHigh` equivalent to **UILayoutPriorityDefaultHigh**  > `.priorityMedium` is half way between high and low  > `.priorityLow` equivalent to **UILayoutPriorityDefaultLow**  Priorities are can be tacked on to the end of a constraint chain like so: ```obj-c make.left.greaterThanOrEqualTo(label.mas_left).with.priorityLow();  make.top.equalTo(label.mas_top).with.priority(600); ``` 
590,37,https://github.com/xiky/Masonry,"## Composition, composition, composition",3,xiky.Masonry.md,2, Masonry also gives you a few convenience methods which create multiple constraints at the same time. These are called MASCompositeConstraints

593,37,https://github.com/xiky/Masonry,#### center,3,xiky.Masonry.md,4,"```obj-c // make centerX and centerY = button1 make.center.equalTo(button1)  // make centerX = superview.centerX - 5, centerY = superview.centerY + 10 make.center.equalTo(superview).centerOffset(CGPointMake(-5, 10)) ```  You can chain view attributes for increased readability:  ```obj-c // All edges but the top should equal those of the superview make.left.right.and.bottom.equalTo(superview); make.top.equalTo(otherView); ``` "
594,37,https://github.com/xiky/Masonry,## Hold on for dear life,3,xiky.Masonry.md,2, Sometimes you need modify existing constraints in order to animate or remove/replace constraints. In Masonry there are a few different approaches to updating constraints. 
595,37,https://github.com/xiky/Masonry,#### 1. References,3,xiky.Masonry.md,4,"You can hold on to a reference of a particular constraint by assigning the result of a constraint make expression to a local variable or a class property. You could also reference multiple constraints by storing them away in an array.  ```obj-c // in public/private interface @property (nonatomic, strong) MASConstraint *topConstraint;  ...  // when making constraints [view1 mas_makeConstraints:^(MASConstraintMaker *make) {     self.topConstraint = make.top.equalTo(superview.mas_top).with.offset(padding.top);     make.left.equalTo(superview.mas_left).with.offset(padding.left); }];  ... // then later you can call [self.topConstraint uninstall]; ``` "
596,37,https://github.com/xiky/Masonry,#### 2. mas_updateConstraints,3,xiky.Masonry.md,4,Alternatively if you are only updating the constant value of the constraint you can use the convience method `mas_updateConstraints` instead of `mas_makeConstraints`  ```obj-c // this is Apple's recommended place for adding/updating constraints // this method can get called multiple times in response to setNeedsUpdateConstraints // which can be called by UIKit internally or in your code if you need to trigger an update to your constraints - (void)updateConstraints {     [self.growingButton mas_updateConstraints:^(MASConstraintMaker *make) {         make.center.equalTo(self);         make.width.equalTo(@(self.buttonSize.width)).priorityLow();         make.height.equalTo(@(self.buttonSize.height)).priorityLow();         make.width.lessThanOrEqualTo(self);         make.height.lessThanOrEqualTo(self);     }];      //according to apple super should be called at end of method     [super updateViewConstraints]; } ``` 
597,37,https://github.com/xiky/Masonry,### 3. mas_remakeConstraints,3,xiky.Masonry.md,3,"`mas_updateConstraints` is useful for updating a set of constraints, but doing anything beyond updating constant values can get exhausting. That's where `mas_remakeConstraints` comes in.  `mas_remakeConstraints` is similar to `mas_updateConstraints`, but instead of updating constant values, it will remove all of its constraints before installing them again. This lets you provide different constraints without having to keep around references to ones which you want to remove.  ```obj-c - (void)changeButtonPosition {     [self.button mas_remakeConstraints:^(MASConstraintMaker *make) {         make.size.equalTo(self.buttonSize);          if (topLeft) {         	make.top.and.left.offset(10);         } else {         	make.bottom.and.right.offset(-10);         }     }]; } ```  You can find more detailed examples of all three approaches in the **Masonry iOS Examples** project. "
598,37,https://github.com/xiky/Masonry,## When the ^&*!@ hits the fan!,3,xiky.Masonry.md,2," Laying out your views doesn't always goto plan. So when things literally go pear shaped, you don't want to be looking at console output like this:  ```obj-c Unable to simultaneously satisfy constraints.....blah blah blah.... (     ""<NSLayoutConstraint:0x7189ac0 V:[UILabel:0x7186980(>=5000)]>"",     ""<NSAutoresizingMaskLayoutConstraint:0x839ea20 h=--& v=--& V:[MASExampleDebuggingView:0x7186560(416)]>"",     ""<NSLayoutConstraint:0x7189c70 UILabel:0x7186980.bottom == MASExampleDebuggingView:0x7186560.bottom - 10>"",     ""<NSLayoutConstraint:0x7189560 V:|-(1)-[UILabel:0x7186980]   (Names: '|':MASExampleDebuggingView:0x7186560 )>"" )  Will attempt to recover by breaking constraint <NSLayoutConstraint:0x7189ac0 V:[UILabel:0x7186980(>=5000)]> ```  Masonry adds a category to NSLayoutConstraint which overrides the default implementation of `- (NSString *)description`. Now you can give meaningful names to views and constraints, and also easily pick out the constraints created by Masonry.  which means your console output can now look like this:  ```obj-c Unable to simultaneously satisfy constraints......blah blah blah.... (     ""<NSAutoresizingMaskLayoutConstraint:0x8887740 MASExampleDebuggingView:superview.height == 416>"",     ""<MASLayoutConstraint:ConstantConstraint UILabel:messageLabel.height >= 5000>"",     ""<MASLayoutConstraint:BottomConstraint UILabel:messageLabel.bottom == MASExampleDebuggingView:superview.bottom - 10>"",     ""<MASLayoutConstraint:ConflictingConstraint[0] UILabel:messageLabel.top == MASExampleDebuggingView:superview.top + 1>"" )  Will attempt to recover by breaking constraint <MASLayoutConstraint:ConstantConstraint UILabel:messageLabel.height >= 5000> ```  For an example of how to set this up take a look at the **Masonry iOS Examples** project in the Masonry workspace.

617,40,https://github.com/scollison/huginn,## Getting Started,3,scollison.huginn.md,2,
618,40,https://github.com/scollison/huginn,### Docker,6,scollison.huginn.md,3, The quickest and easiest way to check out Huginn is to use the offical Docker image. Have a look at the [documentation](./doc/docker/install.md). 
619,40,https://github.com/scollison/huginn,### Local Installation,36,scollison.huginn.md,3," If you just want to play around, you can simply fork this repository, then perform the following steps:  * Run `git remote add upstream https://github.com/cantino/huginn.git` to add the main repository as a remote for your fork. * Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (`cp .env.example .env`) and edit `.env`, at least updating the `APP_SECRET_TOKEN` variable. * Run `bundle` to install dependencies * Run `bundle exec rake db:create`, `bundle exec rake db:migrate`, and then `bundle exec rake db:seed` to create a development MySQL database with some example Agents. * Run `bundle exec foreman start`, visit [http://localhost:3000/][localhost], and login with the username of `admin` and the password of `password`. * Setup some Agents! * Read the [wiki][wiki] for usage examples and to get started making new Agents. * Periodically run `git fetch upstream` and then `git checkout master && git merge upstream/master` to merge in the newest version of Huginn.  Note: By default, emails are intercepted in the `development` Rails environment, which is what you just setup.  You can view them at [http://localhost:3000/letter_opener](http://localhost:3000/letter_opener). If you'd like to send real emails via SMTP when playing with Huginn locally, set `SEND_EMAIL_IN_DEVELOPMENT` to `true` in your `.env` file.  If you need more detailed instructions, see the [Novice setup guide][novice-setup-guide].  [localhost]: http://localhost:3000/ [wiki]: https://github.com/cantino/huginn/wiki [novice-setup-guide]: https://github.com/cantino/huginn/wiki/Novice-setup-guide "
620,40,https://github.com/scollison/huginn,### Develop,36,scollison.huginn.md,3," All agents have specs! Test all specs with `bundle exec rspec`, or test a specific spec with `bundle exec rspec path/to/specific/spec.rb`. Read more about rspec for rails [here](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails). "
621,40,https://github.com/scollison/huginn,## Deployment,3,scollison.huginn.md,2,
622,40,https://github.com/scollison/huginn,### Heroku,36,scollison.huginn.md,3," Try Huginn on Heroku: [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy) (Takes a few minutes to setup. Read the [documentation](./doc/heroku/install.md) while you are waiting and be sure to click 'View it' after launch!)  Huginn works on the free version of Heroku [with significant limitations](https://github.com/cantino/huginn/blob/master/doc/heroku/install.md). For non-experimental use, we strongly recommend Heroku's cheapest paid plan or our Docker container.  Please see [the Huginn Wiki](https://github.com/cantino/huginn/wiki#deploying-huginn) for detailed deployment strategies for different providers. "
623,40,https://github.com/scollison/huginn,### Manual installation on any server,36,scollison.huginn.md,3, Have a look at the [installation guide](./doc/manual/README.md). 
624,40,https://github.com/scollison/huginn,### Optional Setup,3,scollison.huginn.md,3,
625,40,https://github.com/scollison/huginn,#### Setup for private development,6,scollison.huginn.md,4, See [private development instructions](https://github.com/cantino/huginn/wiki/Private-development-instructions) on the wiki. 
626,40,https://github.com/scollison/huginn,#### Enable the WeatherAgent,3,scollison.huginn.md,4, In order to use the WeatherAgent you need an [API key with Wunderground](http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/). Signup for one and then change the value of `api_key: your-key` in your seeded WeatherAgent. 
627,40,https://github.com/scollison/huginn,#### Disable SSL,3,scollison.huginn.md,4," We assume your deployment will run over SSL. This is a very good idea! However, if you wish to turn this off, you'll probably need to edit `config/initializers/devise.rb` and modify the line containing `config.rememberable_options = { :secure => true }`.  You will also need to edit `config/environments/production.rb` and modify the value of `config.force_ssl`. "

646,42,https://github.com/dondre/angular-cli,## Installation,3,dondre.angular-cli.md,2, **BEFORE YOU INSTALL:** please read the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) ```bash npm install -g angular-cli ``` 
647,42,https://github.com/dondre/angular-cli,## Usage,3,dondre.angular-cli.md,2, ```bash ng help ``` 
648,42,https://github.com/dondre/angular-cli,### Generating and serving an Angular2 project via a development server,3,dondre.angular-cli.md,3, ```bash ng new PROJECT_NAME cd PROJECT_NAME ng serve ``` Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.  You can configure the default HTTP port and the one used by the LiveReload server with two command-line options :  ```bash ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4201 --live-reload-port 49153 ``` 
649,42,https://github.com/dondre/angular-cli,"### Generating Components, Directives, Pipes and Services",3,dondre.angular-cli.md,3, You can use the `ng generate` (or just `ng g`) command to generate Angular components:  ```bash ng generate component my-new-component ng g component my-new-component # using the alias 
650,42,https://github.com/dondre/angular-cli,# components support relative path generation,-,dondre.angular-cli.md,1,

653,42,https://github.com/dondre/angular-cli,# but if you were to run,-,dondre.angular-cli.md,1,ng g component ../newer-cmp
654,42,https://github.com/dondre/angular-cli,# your component will be generated in src/app/newer-cmp,-,dondre.angular-cli.md,1,``` You can find all possible blueprints in the table below: 
655,42,https://github.com/dondre/angular-cli,### Generating a route,3,dondre.angular-cli.md,3,"---       | --- Component | `ng g component my-new-component` Directive | `ng g directive my-new-directive` Pipe      | `ng g pipe my-new-pipe` Service   | `ng g service my-new-service` Class     | `ng g class my-new-class` Interface | `ng g interface my-new-interface` Enum      | `ng g enum my-new-enum` Module    | `ng g module my-module`   The CLI supports routing in several ways:  - We include the `@angular/router` NPM package when creating or initializing a project.  - When you generate a module, you can use the `--routing` option like `ng g module my-module --routing`  to create a separate file `my-module-routing.module.ts` to store the module routes.    The file includes an empty `Routes` object that you can fill with routes to different components and/or modules.    The `--routing` option also generates a default component with the same name as the module.  - You can use the `--routing` option with `ng new` or `ng init` to create a `app-routing.module.ts` file when you create or initialize a project.  "
656,42,https://github.com/dondre/angular-cli,### Creating a build,3,dondre.angular-cli.md,3, ```bash ng build ```  The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. 
657,42,https://github.com/dondre/angular-cli,### Build Targets and Environment Files,3,dondre.angular-cli.md,3," `ng build` can specify both a build target (`--target=production` or `--target=development`) and an environment file to be used with that build (`--environment=dev` or `--environment=prod`). By default, the development build target and environment are used.  The mapping used to determine which environment file is used can be found in `angular-cli.json`:  ```json ""environments"": {   ""source"": ""environments/environment.ts"",   ""dev"": ""environments/environment.ts"",   ""prod"": ""environments/environment.prod.ts"" } ```  These options also apply to the serve command. If you do not pass a value for `environment`, it will default to `dev` for `development` and `prod` for `production`.  ```bash"
658,42,https://github.com/dondre/angular-cli,# these are equivalent,-,dondre.angular-cli.md,1,ng build --target=production --environment=prod ng build --prod --env=prod ng build --prod
659,42,https://github.com/dondre/angular-cli,# and so are these,-,dondre.angular-cli.md,1,"ng build --target=development --environment=dev ng build --dev --e=dev ng build --dev ng build ```  You can also add your own env files other than `dev` and `prod` by doing the following: - create a `src/environments/environment.NAME.ts` - add `{ ""NAME"": 'src/environments/environment.NAME.ts' }` to the `apps[0].environments` object in `angular-cli.json` - use them via the `--env=NAME` flag on the build/serve commands. "
660,42,https://github.com/dondre/angular-cli,### Base tag handling in index.html,3,dondre.angular-cli.md,3," When building you can modify base tag (`<base href=""/"">`) in your index.html with `--base-href your-url` option.  ```bash"
661,42,https://github.com/dondre/angular-cli,# Sets base tag href to /myUrl/ in your index.html,-,dondre.angular-cli.md,1,ng build --base-href /myUrl/ ng build --bh /myUrl/ ``` 
662,42,https://github.com/dondre/angular-cli,### Bundling,3,dondre.angular-cli.md,3," All builds make use of bundling, and using the `--prod` flag in  `ng build --prod` or `ng serve --prod` will also make use of uglifying and tree-shaking functionality. "
663,42,https://github.com/dondre/angular-cli,### Running unit tests,3,dondre.angular-cli.md,3," ```bash ng test ```  Tests will execute after a build is executed via [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html), and it will automatically watch your files for changes. You can run tests a single time via `--watch=false` or `--single-run`.  You can run tests with coverage via `--code-coverage`. The coverage report will be in the `coverage/` directory.  Linting during tests is also available via the `--lint` flag. See [Linting and formatting code](#linting-and-formatting-code) chapter for more informations. "
664,42,https://github.com/dondre/angular-cli,### Running end-to-end tests,3,dondre.angular-cli.md,3, ```bash ng e2e ```  Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.  End-to-end tests are run via [Protractor](https://angular.github.io/protractor/). 
665,42,https://github.com/dondre/angular-cli,### Proxy To Backend,3,dondre.angular-cli.md,3,"Using the proxying support in webpack's dev server we can highjack certain urls and send them to a backend server. We do this by passing a file to `--proxy-config`  Say we have a server running on `http://localhost:3000/api` and we want all calls to `http://localhost:4200/api` to go to that server.  We create a file next to projects `package.json` called `proxy.conf.json` with the content  ```json {   ""/api"": {     ""target"": ""http://localhost:3000"",     ""secure"": false   } } ```  You can read more about what options are available here [webpack-dev-server proxy settings](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html#proxy)  and then we edit the `package.json` file's start script to be  ```json ""start"": ""ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json"", ```  now run it with `npm start` "
666,42,https://github.com/dondre/angular-cli,### Deploying the app via GitHub Pages,3,dondre.angular-cli.md,3," You can deploy your apps quickly via:  ```bash ng github-pages:deploy --message ""Optional commit message"" ```  This will do the following:  - creates GitHub repo for the current project if one doesn't exist - rebuilds the app in production mode at the current `HEAD` - creates a local `gh-pages` branch if one doesn't exist - moves your app to the `gh-pages` branch and creates a commit - edit the base tag in index.html to support GitHub Pages - pushes the `gh-pages` branch to GitHub - returns back to the original `HEAD`  Creating the repo requires a token from GitHub, and the remaining functionality relies on ssh authentication for all git operations that communicate with github.com. To simplify the authentication, be sure to [setup your ssh keys](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/).  If you are deploying a [user or organization page](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/), you can instead use the following command:  ```bash ng github-pages:deploy --user-page --message ""Optional commit message"" ```  This command pushes the app to the `master` branch on the GitHub repo instead of pushing to `gh-pages`, since user and organization pages require this.  "
667,42,https://github.com/dondre/angular-cli,### Linting and formatting code,3,dondre.angular-cli.md,3, You can lint your app code by running `ng lint`. This will use the `lint` npm script that in generated projects uses `tslint`.  You can modify the these scripts in `package.json` to run whatever tool you prefer. 
668,42,https://github.com/dondre/angular-cli,### Commands autocompletion,3,dondre.angular-cli.md,3, To turn on auto completion use the following commands:  For bash: ```bash ng completion 1>> ~/.bashrc 2>>&1 source ~/.bashrc ```  For zsh: ```bash ng completion 1>> ~/.zshrc 2>>&1 source ~/.zshrc ```  Windows users using gitbash: ```bash ng completion 1>> ~/.bash_profile 2>>&1 source ~/.bash_profile ``` 
669,42,https://github.com/dondre/angular-cli,### Project assets,3,dondre.angular-cli.md,3," You use the `assets` array in `angular-cli.json` to list files or folders you want to copy as-is when building your project: ```json ""assets"": [   ""assets"",   ""favicon.ico"" ] ``` "
670,42,https://github.com/dondre/angular-cli,### Global styles,3,dondre.angular-cli.md,3," The `styles.css` file allows users to add global styles and supports [CSS imports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/@import).  If the project is created with the `--style=sass` option, this will be a `.sass` file instead, and the same applies to `scss/less/styl`.  You can add more global styles via the `apps[0].styles` property in `angular-cli.json`. "
671,42,https://github.com/dondre/angular-cli,### CSS Preprocessor integration,36,dondre.angular-cli.md,3," Angular-CLI supports all major CSS preprocessors: - sass/scss ([http://sass-lang.com/](http://sass-lang.com/)) - less ([http://lesscss.org/](http://lesscss.org/)) - stylus ([http://stylus-lang.com/](http://stylus-lang.com/))  To use these preprocessors simply add the file to your component's `styleUrls`:  ```javascript @Component({   selector: 'app-root',   templateUrl: './app.component.html',   styleUrls: ['./app.component.scss'] }) export class AppComponent {   title = 'app works!'; } ```  When generating a new project you can also define which extension you want for style files:  ```bash ng new sassy-project --style=sass ```  Or set the default style on an existing project:  ```bash ng set defaults.styleExt scss ``` "
672,42,https://github.com/dondre/angular-cli,### 3rd Party Library Installation,3,dondre.angular-cli.md,3," Simply install your library via `npm install lib-name --save` and import it in your code.  If the library does not include typings, you can install them using npm:  ```bash npm install d3 --save npm install @types/d3 --save-dev ```  If the library doesn't have typings available at `@types/`, you can still use it by manually adding typings for it:  1. First, create a `typings.d.ts` file in your `src/` folder. This file will be automatically included as global type definition.  2. Then, in `src/typings.d.ts`, add the following code:    ```typescript   declare module 'typeless-package';   ```  3. Finally, in the component or file that uses the library, add the following code:    ```typescript   import * as typelessPackage from 'typeless-package';   typelessPackage.method();   ```  Done. Note: you might need or find useful to define more typings for the library that you're trying to use. "
673,42,https://github.com/dondre/angular-cli,### Global Library Installation,3,dondre.angular-cli.md,3," Some javascript libraries need to be added to the global scope, and loaded as if they were in a script tag. We can do this using the `apps[0].scripts` and `apps[0].styles` properties of `angular-cli.json`.  As an example, to use [Bootstrap 4](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/) this is what you need to do:  First install Bootstrap from `npm`:  ```bash npm install bootstrap@next ```  Then add the needed script files to `apps[0].scripts`:  ```json ""scripts"": [   ""../node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.js"",   ""../node_modules/tether/dist/js/tether.js"",   ""../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.js"" ], ```  Finally add the Bootstrap CSS to the `apps[0].styles` array: ```json ""styles"": [   ""../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css"",   ""styles.css"" ], ```  Restart `ng serve` if you're running it, and Bootstrap 4 should be working on your app. "
674,42,https://github.com/dondre/angular-cli,### Updating angular-cli,36,dondre.angular-cli.md,3," To update `angular-cli` to a new version, you must update both the global package and your project's local package.  Global package: ```bash npm uninstall -g angular-cli npm cache clean npm install -g angular-cli@latest ```  Local project package: ```bash rm -rf node_modules dist # use rmdir on Windows npm install --save-dev angular-cli@latest npm install ng init ```  Running `ng init` will check for changes in all the auto-generated files created by `ng new` and allow you to update yours. You are offered four choices for each changed file: `y` (overwrite), `n` (don't overwrite), `d` (show diff between your file and the updated file) and `h` (help).  Carefully read the diffs for each code file, and either accept the changes or incorporate them manually after `ng init` finishes.  **The main cause of errors after an update is failing to incorporate these updates into your code**.  You can find more details about changes between versions in [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).  "
675,42,https://github.com/dondre/angular-cli,## Development Hints for hacking on angular-cli,3,dondre.angular-cli.md,2,
676,42,https://github.com/dondre/angular-cli,### Working with master,36,dondre.angular-cli.md,3," ```bash git clone https://github.com/angular/angular-cli.git cd angular-cli npm link ```  `npm link` is very similar to `npm install -g` except that instead of downloading the package from the repo, the just cloned `angular-cli/` folder becomes the global package. Any changes to the files in the `angular-cli/` folder will immediately affect the global `angular-cli` package, allowing you to quickly test any changes you make to the cli project.  Now you can use `angular-cli` via the command line:  ```bash ng new foo cd foo npm link angular-cli ng serve ```  `npm link angular-cli` is needed because by default the globally installed `angular-cli` just loads the local `angular-cli` from the project which was fetched remotely from npm. `npm link angular-cli` symlinks the global `angular-cli` package to the local `angular-cli` package. Now the `angular-cli` you cloned before is in three places: The folder you cloned it into, npm's folder where it stores global packages and the `angular-cli` project you just created.  You can also use `ng new foo --link-cli` to automatically link the `angular-cli` package.  Please read the official [npm-link documentation](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/cli/npm-link.html) and the [npm-link cheatsheet](http://browsenpm.org/help#linkinganynpmpackagelocally) for more information.

688,44,https://github.com/BrunoBozza/CNTK,## What is CNTK,12,BrunoBozza.CNTK.md,2,"CNTK (http://www.cntk.ai/), the Computational Network Toolkit by Microsoft Research, is a unified deep-learning toolkit that describes neural networks as a series of computational steps via a directed graph. In this directed graph, leaf nodes represent input values or network parameters, while other nodes represent matrix operations upon their inputs. CNTK allows to easily realize and combine popular model types such as feed-forward DNNs, convolutional nets (CNNs), and recurrent networks (RNNs/LSTMs). It implements stochastic gradient descent (SGD, error backpropagation) learning with automatic differentiation and parallelization across multiple GPUs and servers. CNTK has been available under an open-source license since April 2015. It is our hope that the community will take advantage of CNTK to share ideas more quickly through the exchange of open source working code.  Wiki: Go to the [CNTK Wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/wiki) for all information on CNTK including [setup](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/wiki/Setup-CNTK-on-your-machine ), [examples](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/wiki/Examples ), etc.  License: See [LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md) in the root of this repository for the full license information.

We are living in a world that everything is connected through internet and to provide security on this connections the majority of them use TLS. But we have seen how some governments use different aproach to circumvent them. Some of this vulnerabilities can be due to bugs in the implementations, bad deployments ... etc, but one of the vulnerability that this work try to resolve is the bad or poor validation of certificates.  Before to send our private data to the other entity, usually in TLS, we have to validate the authenticity of the server with the goal to know that it is who claim it is. We have seen how apple failed in this due to the famous goto fail bug  <https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/02/22/applebug.html>. Although is true that this vulnerability is because of a bad implementation is true that if apple had provided other techniques this situation could be discovered before. Our goal will be to validate each connection with different techniques because maybe an approach says that our connection is secure but perhaps there is another one that says the opposite providing a better solution. "

First we have to configure the directory that hold them.  ```bash $ mkdir -p ~/.pki/nssdb $ cd ~/.pki/nssdb $ certutil -N -d . ``` I use this but any directory is fine. If you change the directory you have to change the config file and set `NSS_DB_DIR`. By the default is `""~/.pki/nssdb""`. Also we have to set the variable `CERTS_DIR`in the config file to say where reside our certificates. This project provide the root Mozilla's certificates in the `certs` folder. Also you should set the log directory `LOG_DIR`.  ```bash $ cd {project} $ cd utils $ python nssdb.py --add ```  In case that you want to remove it from the database  ```bash $ python nssdb.py --delete ```  -"

702,46,https://github.com/blairanderson/amazon-autocomplete,#Amazon Autocomplete JS Plugin,13,blairanderson.amazon-autocomplete.md,1,AmazonAutocomplete is a vanilla JavaScript plugin to unlock the full power of the Amazon autocompletion engine right into your search input.  **Demo**: [http://carlosroso.com/amazon-autocomplete](http://carlosroso.com/amazon-autocomplete)  ![demo gif](http://i.imgur.com/4whMwjM.gif) 
703,46,https://github.com/blairanderson/amazon-autocomplete,##Installation,3,blairanderson.amazon-autocomplete.md,2,"You can just grab the minified file from `/dist` or unminified from `/src` but I highly recommend installation through npm.  ``` npm install --save amazon-autocomplete ```  If you think npm is just so 2015 or just feeling hipster, you can install it using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as well:  ``` yarn add amazon-autocomplete ```  Now add it to your html file:  ```html <html>   <body>     ...     <script src=""/path/to/amazon-autocomplete.min.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>   </body> </html> ``` "
704,46,https://github.com/blairanderson/amazon-autocomplete,##Usage,3,blairanderson.amazon-autocomplete.md,2,"Create a text input in your html file for the search field.  ```html <input type=""text"" id=""search-input""/> ```  Edit your main JavaScript file to create an AmazonAutocomplete instance with your search field CSS selector.  ```javascript let searchInput = new AmazonAutocomplete('#search-input'); ```  Now you got a search field on steroids. Go ahead and apply some styles to make it shine.  "
705,46,https://github.com/blairanderson/amazon-autocomplete,##Styling,3,blairanderson.amazon-autocomplete.md,2,"This is a pretty lightweight JavaScript library so it applies just a few styles to some elements to make it work. You can apply your own styles and customize the look of all the components within the widget. If you’re not that much into CSS, you can grab the following snippet and safely shot it into your stylesheet to get a decent default look. As you can see, AmazonAutocomplete goes all the way [BEM](https://en.bem.info/methodology/css/).  ```css /* Words container */ .ac__inner{     background: #f6f6f6; }  /* Individual word element */ .ac__word{     margin: 0;     padding: 5px; }  /* Word prefix style. It’s the span containing the search keyword within the word. */ .ac__prefix{     font-weight: bold; }  /* Style applied to each words while navigating through the list or on hover */ .ac__word--selected, .ac__word:hover{     background-color: #e3e3e3; } ``` "

707,46,https://github.com/blairanderson/amazon-autocomplete,###Configuration,3,blairanderson.amazon-autocomplete.md,3,You can customize the plugin behaviour by passing along a config object when instantiating AmazonAutocomplete. These are the properties you can specify: 
708,46,https://github.com/blairanderson/amazon-autocomplete,####`new AmazonAutocomplete([paramsObject])`,3,blairanderson.amazon-autocomplete.md,4,

This attribute will set the fire rate limit (in milliseconds) on the keyup event callback. Default: `200` showWords | `boolean` | No | Enable/disable revealing of the words list panel. Can be useful if you want to show the suggested words on your own custom widget. Default: `true` hideOnblur | `boolean` | No | Indicates whether the words list panel should hide when the search field loses focus. Default: `true`  Each AmazonAutocomplete instance will fire some events. You can susbscribe to these events to, for example, save the selected word in your DB or to show suggested words in your own widget. "
710,46,https://github.com/blairanderson/amazon-autocomplete,###Advanced usage example,3,blairanderson.amazon-autocomplete.md,3,"------------ | ------------- | ------------- onSelectedWord | `string` | This is event is fired when some of the following actions takes place: <ul><li>User clicks a word</li><li>User navigates through the words list and hits enter</li><li>User types keyword and hits enter (no suggested word selected)</li></ul>The callback function will be called with the selected word as its only argument. onNewWords | `array` | This is event is fired when there are new suggested words available. It mostly happens when the keyup event fires on the search field. Keep in mind that the keyup is debounced to improve performance.  The next snippet shows how to initialize a AmazonAutocomplete with a 200ms debounce limit, not showing the words panel and not hiding on input text blur. As the words won’t show in the dropdown panel we’ll have to shown them in a custom panel.  ```javascript //Create the AmazonAutocomplete with our desired properties let searchInput = new AmazonAutocomplete({             selector: '#search-input',             delay: 200,             showWords: false,             hideOnblur: false         });  //Log the selected word to the console searchInput.onSelectedWord(word => console.log(`searching for ${word}...`));  //Populate your custom panel whenever there are new suggested words available searchInput.onNewWords(words => words.forEach(word => addWordToCustomPanel(word))); ```  "

Goes down to 2.8kb when gzipped. - **Browser support**: Amazon Autocomplete is supported by all major browsers and +IE10. I don’t have any plans to ever support IE8 on any of my projects. - **Library Agnostic**: This plugin is all about vanilla JavaScript. No jQuery required. You can use it in any of your projects whether you’re working on Angular, React, Vue, or plain JavaScript. - **JSONP**: Yep. Amazon Autocomplete uses JSONP to fetch the data from Amazon. Requests are not being made via XHR because of the same-origin policy. Fortunately, the Amazon autocompletion endpoint is JSONP enabled so we can bypass this restriction. - **Multiple instances**: You can have multiple search fields in the same page all of them powered with Amazon Autocomplete. Don’t worry about setting different callbacks when fetching the Amazon autocompletion endpoint. Just create a new instance for each search field and this plugin will automagically handle everything for you. How cool huh? - **Keyup debounced**: With great power comes great responsibility. You don’t want to execute a GET request each time the user types a character and overload the Amazon autocompletion engine server. Amazon Autocomplete debounces the keyup event so that it will request new words only if some time has passed since last request. This is called [debouncing](https://davidwalsh.name/javascript-debounce-function).  "

732,49,https://github.com/kevinboudot/silex-cache-service-provider,## Using multiple caches,3,kevinboudot.silex-cache-service-provider.md,2," The Cache provider can allow access to multiple caches. In order to configure the cache drivers, replace the `cache.options` with `caches.options`. `caches.options` is an array of configurations where keys are cache names and values are options:  ```php $app->register(new Moust\Silex\Provider\CacheServiceProvider(), array(     'caches.options' => array(         'apc' => array(             'driver' => 'apc'         ),         'filesystem' => array(             'driver' => 'file',             'cache_dir' => './temp'         ),         'memory' => array(             'driver' => 'array'         ),         'memcache' => array(             'driver' => 'memcache',             'memcache' => function () {                 $memcache = new \Memcache;                 $memcache->connect('localhost', 11211);                 return $memcache;             }         )     ) )); ```  The first registered cache is the default and can simply be accessed as you would if there was only one. Given the above configuration, these two lines are equivalent:  ```php $app['cache']->store('foo', 'bar');  $app['caches']['apc']->store('foo', 'bar'); ``` "

Use Rails's `render` method to render a partial 3. Describe how the name of a partial turns into its filename 4. Reference partials located in an external folder 
742,51,https://github.com/mcansh/simple-partials-reading-v-000,## Introduction,1,mcansh.simple-partials-reading-v-000.md,2," As you know, while coding we are generally trying to not repeat our code. If we see a repeated chunk of code in different methods, we sometimes extract that chunk of code into its own method, which we can then reference in multiple places.  We can apply a similar tool to reduce repetition in HTML. Partials are view-level files that only form one part of an HTML page. By using a partial, we can remove repeated pieces of HTML and add better organization to the code in our views.  Let's look at an example to see what this means. "
743,51,https://github.com/mcansh/simple-partials-reading-v-000,## Example,3,mcansh.simple-partials-reading-v-000.md,2," Before we get started, make sure that you run `rake db:seed` to seed the database. This will give us some posts and authors. Because we want to focus on partials, you'll notice some hard-coding in the controller. In the `posts#create` action, we've hard-coded that every new post created is linked to the very first author in the database.  OK, let's dive in!  This is the code in the `posts#new` form: ```erb <!-- app/views/posts/new.html.erb -->  <%= form_tag posts_path do %>   <label>Post title:</label><br>   <%= text_field_tag :title %><br>    <label>Post Description</label><br>   <%= text_area_tag :description %><br>    <%= submit_tag ""Submit Post"" %> <% end %> ``` And this is the code in the `posts#edit` form: ```erb <!-- app/views/posts/edit.html.erb -->  <h3>Post Form</h3>  <%= form_tag post_path(@post), method: ""put"" do %>   <label>Post title:</label><br>   <%= text_field_tag :title %><br>    <label>Post Description</label><br>   <%= text_area_tag :description %><br>    <%= submit_tag ""Submit Post"" %> <% end %> ```  Except for the first line of the form, the code is pretty much the same! The labels and field tags are the same. All of that duplication is not good in code. Duplication means twice the amount of code to maintain, twice the opportunity for bugs, and two slightly different forms when our interface should be consistent.  Instead of duplicating all of that code, we just want to write it once in our partial and call it from both our edit and show views. Here's how:  First, let's create a new file in `app/views/posts/` called `_form.html.erb`. To indicate that this file is a partial (and only part of a larger view), an underscore is prefixed to the filename.  Second, let's remove the repeated code in `app/views/posts/edit.html.erb`. The file should look like this:  ```erb <h3>Post Form</h3>  <%= form_tag post_path(@post), method: ""put"" do %> <% end %> ``` Note that we left in the non-duplicated code. Now, let's also remove the duplicated code in the `app/views/posts/new.html.erb` file. The file should look like this:  ```erb <%= form_tag posts_path do %> <% end %> ``` We left the code that is unique to each view and removed the duplicated code inside the `form_tag` blocks.  So, now what? It looks like we are missing a bunch of code in our `posts/new` and `posts/edit` files. Not to worry –– that's where our partial comes in handy.  First, we'll place the duplicated code in a new file called `app/views/posts/_form.html.erb`. The file should look as follows: ```erb <label>Post title:</label><br> <%= text_field_tag :title %><br>  <label>Post Description</label><br> <%= text_area_tag :description %><br>  <%= submit_tag ""Submit Post"" %> ``` Next, we need to render the code into the `posts/edit` and `posts/new` pages by placing `<%= render ""form"" %>` where we want the code in the partial to be rendered. Notice that, while the file name of our partial starts with an underscore, when we reference it there is no underscore.  Our `posts/new` file should now look like this: ```erb <!-- app/views/posts/new.html.erb -->  <%= form_tag posts_path do %>  <%= render 'form' %> <% end %> ```  And our `posts/edit` file like this: ```erb <!-- app/views/posts/edit.html.erb -->  <h3>Post Form</h3>  <%= form_tag post_path(@post), method: ""put"" do %>   <%= render 'form' %> <% end %> ```  And that's it –– we're all done!  A couple of things to note: 1. Notice that, even though the last line of the form (the `<% end %>` tag) is duplicated code, we didn't move it into the partial. This is because it closes the beginning of the `form_tag` block, which DOES differ from form to form. We don't want to open our `form_tag` block in one file and close it in a different file. This is a stylistic point that you will get a feel for over time.  2. We could have named the partial whatever we wanted to. The only requirements are that it start with an underscore and that references to the partial are made without the underscore. But, just like method names, it's good to make the names of our partials as commonsensical as possible.  3. We were able to reference the partial by just calling `<%= render 'form' %>`.  Notice that we didn't specify the folder that the partial lives in, such as `<%= render 'posts/form' %>`. The reason we didn't need this (even though it would have worked if we had included it) is that both the `posts/new` and `posts/edit` files are referencing a partial housed in the same folder in which they reside, `app/views/posts`. When referencing a partial from a different folder, we must include the folder name as well (e.g., `<%= render 'posts/form' %>` as opposed to `<%= render 'form' %>`).  "
744,51,https://github.com/mcansh/simple-partials-reading-v-000,## Rendering a partial from a different folder,3,mcansh.simple-partials-reading-v-000.md,2," Let's take a look at our `authors/show.html.erb` file:  ```erb <%= @author.name %> <%= @author.hometown %> ```  And now look at the code in `posts/show.html.erb`:  ```erb <%= @post.author.name %> <%= @post.author.hometown %>  <h1><%= @post.title %></h1> <p><%= @post.description %></p> ```  See the repetition? In both places, we are using the `Author` object to call the `.name` and `.hometown` methods. The first thing we have to fix is the slight difference between the templates. Let's make the beginning portion of the `posts/show` template match the `authors/show` template.  ```erb <!-- app/views/posts/show.html.erb -->  <%= @author.name %> <%= @author.hometown %>  <h1><%= @post.title %></h1> <p><%= @post.description %></p> ```  Then, let's make a new partial called `app/views/authors/_author.html.erb` and place the repeated code in the file. It should look like the following:  ```erb <!-- app/views/authors/_author.html.erb -->  <%= @author.name %> <%= @author.hometown %> ```  Now we can just render this partial in our `authors/show` page by doing the following:  ```erb <!-- app/views/authors/show.html.erb -->  <%= render 'author' %> ```  Let's try making the same change to our `posts/show` page:  ```erb <!-- app/views/posts/show.html.erb -->  <%= render 'author' %>  <h1><%= @post.title %></h1> <p><%= @post.description %></p> ```  Uh oh, something went wrong. This won't work because, if we don't specify the partial's parent folder, Rails assumes that the partial lives in the same folder as the view that's calling it. In this case, it looks for a file in the `posts` directory called `_author.html.erb` and doesn't find it. We need to tell Rails to go outside the folder by being explicit about the folder and file name that it should render. We can do that by changing the above code to the following:  ```erb <!-- app/views/posts/show.html.erb -->  <%= render 'authors/author' %>  <h1><%= @post.title %></h1> <p><%= @post.description %></p> ```  We're almost there! One more problem is that our partial assumes it has access to an instance variable called `@author`. The partial won't function without it! We'll need to modify the `PostsController` to have it set that instance variable.  Change the `posts#show` action in the controller to look like the following:  ```ruby"

758,53,https://github.com/Scott-O-Brian/docker-node,### Notes,3,Scott-O-Brian.docker-node.md,3, The image assumes that your application has a file named [`package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) listing its dependencies and defining its [start script](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts#default-values).  It also assumes that you have a file named [`.dockerignore`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#/dockerignore-file) otherwise it will copy your local npm modules:  ``` node_modules ```  We have assembled a [Best Practices Guide](./docs/BestPractices.md) for those using these images on a daily basis. 
759,53,https://github.com/Scott-O-Brian/docker-node,## Run a single Node.js script,3,Scott-O-Brian.docker-node.md,2," For many simple, single file projects, you may find it inconvenient to write a complete `Dockerfile`. In such cases, you can run a Node.js script by using the Node.js Docker image directly:  ```console $ docker run -it --rm --name my-running-script -v ""$PWD"":/usr/src/app -w /usr/src/app node:4 node your-daemon-or-script.js ``` "
760,53,https://github.com/Scott-O-Brian/docker-node,## Verbosity,3,Scott-O-Brian.docker-node.md,2," By default the Node.js Docker Image has npm log verbosity set to `info` instead of the default `warn`. This is because of the way Docker is isolated from the host operating system and you are not guaranteed to be able to retrieve the `npm-debug.log` file when npm fails.  When npm fails, it writes it's verbose log to a log file inside the container. If npm fails during an install when building a Docker Image with the `docker build` command, this log file will become inaccessible when Docker exits.  The Docker Working Group have chosen to be overly verbose during a build to provide an easy audit trail when install fails. If you prefer npm to be less verbose you can easily reset the verbosity of npm using the following techniques: "
761,53,https://github.com/Scott-O-Brian/docker-node,### Dockerfile,3,Scott-O-Brian.docker-node.md,3, If you create your own `Dockerfile` which inherits from the `node` image you can simply use `ENV` to override `NPM_CONFIG_LOGLEVEL`.  ``` FROM node ENV NPM_CONFIG_LOGLEVEL warn ... ```

765,53,https://github.com/Scott-O-Brian/docker-node,## `node:<version>`,3,Scott-O-Brian.docker-node.md,2," This is the defacto image. If you are unsure about what your needs are, you probably want to use this one. It is designed to be used both as a throw away container (mount your source code and start the container to start your app), as well as the base to build other images off of. This tag is based off of [`buildpack-deps`](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/buildpack-deps/). `buildpack-deps` is designed for the average user of docker who has many images on their system. It, by design, has a large number of extremely common Debian packages. This reduces the number of packages that images that derive from it need to install, thus reducing the overall size of all images on your system. "
766,53,https://github.com/Scott-O-Brian/docker-node,## `node:alpine`,36,Scott-O-Brian.docker-node.md,2," This image is based on the popular [Alpine Linux project](http://alpinelinux.org), available in [the `alpine` official image](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine). Alpine Linux is much smaller than most distribution base images (~5MB), and thus leads to much slimmer images in general.  This variant is highly recommended when final image size being as small as possible is desired. The main caveat to note is that it does use [musl libc](http://www.musl-libc.org) instead of [glibc and friends](http://www.etalabs.net/compare_libcs.html), so certain software might run into issues depending on the depth of their libc requirements. However, most software doesn't have an issue with this, so this variant is usually a very safe choice. See [this Hacker News comment thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10782897) for more discussion of the issues that might arise and some pro/con comparisons of using Alpine-based images.  To minimize image size, it's uncommon for additional related tools (such as `git` or `bash`) to be included in Alpine-based images. Using this image as a base, add the things you need in your own Dockerfile (see the [`alpine` image description](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/) for examples of how to install packages if you are unfamiliar).  "
767,53,https://github.com/Scott-O-Brian/docker-node,## `node:onbuild`,36,Scott-O-Brian.docker-node.md,2," This image makes building derivative images easier. For most use cases, creating a `Dockerfile` in the base of your project directory with the line `FROM node:onbuild` will be enough to create a stand-alone image for your project.  While the `onbuild` variant is really useful for ""getting off the ground running"" (zero to Dockerized in a short period of time), it's not recommended for long-term usage within a project due to the lack of control over *when* the `ONBUILD` triggers fire (see also [`docker/docker#5714`](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/5714), [`docker/docker#8240`](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/8240), [`docker/docker#11917`](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/11917)).  Once you've got a handle on how your project functions within Docker, you'll probably want to adjust your `Dockerfile` to inherit from a non-`onbuild` variant and copy the commands from the `onbuild` variant `Dockerfile` (moving the `ONBUILD` lines to the end and removing the `ONBUILD` keywords) into your own file so that you have tighter control over them and more transparency for yourself and others looking at your `Dockerfile` as to what it does. This also makes it easier to add additional requirements as time goes on (such as installing more packages before performing the previously-`ONBUILD` steps).

Your code file **should include code for reading the data** so that the plot can be fully reproduced. You should also include the code that creates the PNG file.  * Add the PNG file and R code file to your git repository  When you are finished with the assignment, push your git repository to GitHub so that the GitHub version of your repository is up to date. There should be four PNG files and four R code files.   The four plots that you will need to construct are shown below.  "

781,55,https://github.com/ywisax/gdufer,## 关于广金在线,-,ywisax.gdufer.md,2, 初入广金时，我就发现广金跟大多数学校不同。 相比于很多高校来说，他太年轻了，缺失太多东西。 以网络空间为例，虽然有广金后院的存在，但是已经名存实亡，广金连一个稳定的学生虚拟社区都不存在，只能是去微博树洞。  我始终认为，BBS类的应用在高校中是很有必要存在的。 微博这类碎片化的应用，不利于学生利用网络来沉淀学识。 百度贴吧本来是个好的平台，但是自主性有太低了。  所以我决定自己动手，建设一个无盈利，纯为学生服务的网上社区。  广金在线是我大二时创建的项目，当时想法很天真，以为自己看到这方面的实际空缺，那么只要开发出产品了，就一定能抢占局面。  事实证明我犯了大多数技术人的错误：太着重技术。  在beta版本推出后，我就尝试去组建团队，寻找更多人来支持这个项目。 但是这时我发现，团队人员很难招募，因为我坚持非盈利，所以很多人都对项目兴趣不大。  所以初期我只能是邀请了我女友做宣传工作，可惜人力微小，收效很低。  既然无法搞好宣传，那我就专心搞技术吧。 再之后的好几个月时间，我努力去完善该站，希望能吸引更多人：换上支持响应式的bootstrap，天天琢磨着如何开发更有用的功能。  可惜啊，ALL FALSE.  在认真考虑一段时间后，我决定把www.gdufer.com开源。 一是为开源世界奉献一份力量； 二也是希望以后的广金师弟师妹如果有同样的想法，可以节省精力，集中精力去完成自己的理想目标。 
782,55,https://github.com/ywisax/gdufer,## 关于源码,-,ywisax.gdufer.md,2, GDUFER整站是由PHP+MySQL组成，其中PHP源码基于Kohana出发。  Kohana是我最喜欢的框架，最早接触的时候可以追溯到高中，那时候刚release了Kohana3.0。我阅读了代码后，果断放弃了已经用TP写了一半的博客程序，换用KO来写。  当时的KO很比较简单，所以我一直对其框架代码进行修改，并用于自己的博客程序中，博客程序命名为XunSec（一直没公开）。  XunSec实际大改了很多次，每次在阅读其他源码，看到一些新的特性时，我都忍不住把它按照新的思路来重构一次。WP、Sablog-X、Joomla，基本都模仿了一次。呵呵。  大二开始写GDUFER时，为了方便，我直接就原来的XunSec进行了修改，并把原来的KO3.0升级到KO3.3，同时参考了ZF的类组织方式，好一番折腾。。。  一路折腾到现在，整套源码已经趋向于比较完整了。  目前已测试过Apache、Nginx、Tengine； 兼容SAE平台（当然有一些地方还是需要你自己修改下的喔）； BAE不熟悉，所以没处理，不过理论上兼容也是没问题的。 
783,55,https://github.com/ywisax/gdufer,## 关于功能,-,ywisax.gdufer.md,2, Kohana使用了modules来组织第三方模块，同时可以很方便地扩展框架功能。具体的内部设计，各位可以研究下Kohana的Request Flow。  一些功能性的modules有：  * Forum         论坛功能 * Auth          用户验证等功能 * Contact       用户留言功能 * Gduf          广金校内一些特殊功能，如校内邮箱登陆，教务系统登陆 * Guide         Kohana自带的用户手册 * Information   未完成的信息分类功能，目前只支持Book类型（也就是书籍发布） * Shop          未完成，商铺功能。 * Weibo         微博发布功能，可作为树洞发布端。 * XunSec        最重要的功能，提供了以页为单位的CMS管理，同时为其他应用级的module提供助手方法  如果有需要制作APP的话，可以直接使用简网之类的在线工具把网站转成APP。当然你也可以直接写个WebView来搞掂（iOS的不懂啊，只会点Android）。 
784,55,https://github.com/ywisax/gdufer,## 最后,-,ywisax.gdufer.md,2, 希望以后在广金能接触更多热爱开源的朋友，我的丘丘是二五八零三四⑦①。  最后就是，因为最初未考虑过要开源，所以并没太在意代码来源。如果发现代码中有缺失版权声明，麻烦联系下我修正。谢谢。
785,56,https://github.com/brismuth/fms-endpoint,# FixMyStreet-endpoint,1,brismuth.fms-endpoint.md,1,"====================  FMS-Endpoint is a simple open source web application for storing problem reports created by mySociety's [FixMyStreet](http://code.fixmystreet.com/) platform. In fact, as it's an [Open311](http://wiki.open311.org/GeoReport_v2) server, it should be happy accepting *any* reports submitted over the Open311 API.  "
786,56,https://github.com/brismuth/fms-endpoint,## Who needs an FMS-endpoint?,1,brismuth.fms-endpoint.md,2,"--------------------------  * if you're running a FixMyStreet deployment already, __you don't necessarily   need a FixMyStreet endpoint!__  FixMyStreet sends reports to the relevant authority/department/council. This is often accomplished by sending an email, but it's usually best if the report can be injected directly into the back-end system. These systems can be large and complex and FixMyStreet can integrate with a growing number of them. The Open311 standard is used by some third parties to simplify this integration process.  However, if you're using FixMyStreet in an environment where the recipient of reports has no established back-end database for collecting reports, FMS-endpoint is a quick solution if you need to get something simple up and running.  "
787,56,https://github.com/brismuth/fms-endpoint,## Installation,3,brismuth.fms-endpoint.md,2,------------  FixMyStreet-endpoint is written in PHP using the CodeIgniter framework. You should find it easy to install provided you have access to a webserver and a database.  The code generally expects to be running under an Apache webserver with a mySQL database. It may be possible change these things if your system is different -- see the installation documentation:  __Installation instructions:__ see `documentation/INSTALL.md`  
788,56,https://github.com/brismuth/fms-endpoint,## Quickstart,3,brismuth.fms-endpoint.md,2,"----------  If you're familiar with PHP CodePoint (or possibly just PHP!) you might be able to get things going just by dropping the repository somewhere under your server root. (In fact, for a super quickstart, set up your webserver so that `web/` *is* the server root).  The FMS-endpoint root page will provide diagnostics even if you've not got the database running, so try hitting that as soon as you get going.  Remember to see `documentation/INSTALL.md` for details. If the home page seems OK, try clicking on __Main site__ and logging in as the default out-of-the-box administrator:    * username: `admin@example.com`   * password: `password`  You must to change these values as soon as you're logged in!

The power of __ActiveRecord__ it gives you and the simplicity of a __Sinatra__ app. And all sort of small helpers. 
792,57,https://github.com/squareteam/yodatra,## Instantly deploy your API,3,squareteam.yodatra.md,2," Based on your ActiveRecord models an API will be exposed very simply. For every resource you want to expose, you will need to create a controller that inherits from the ```Yodatra::ModelsController```.  For example, given a `User` model ```ruby class User < ActiveRecord::Base"
793,57,https://github.com/squareteam/yodatra,# Your model definition,-,squareteam.yodatra.md,1,"end ```  Creating a controller as simple as ```ruby class UsersController < Yodatra::ModelsController   # limit read_scope   def read_scope     { only: [:id, :name] }   end    # whitelist assignable attributes   def user_params     params.permit(:name)   end end ``` will expose all these routes:  ``` GET /users ```  > retrieves all users _(attributes exposed are limited by the `read_scope` method defined in the controller)_  ``` GET /users/:id ```  > retrieves a user _(attributes exposed are limited by the `read_scope` method defined in the controller)_  ``` POST /users ```  > creates a user _(attributes assignable are limited by the `user_params` method defined in the controller as advised here http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#strong-parameters)_  ``` PUT /users/:id ```  > updates a user _(attributes assignable are limited by the `user_params` method defined in the controller as advised here http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#strong-parameters)_  ``` DELETE /users/:id ```  > deletes a user   If your model is referenced by another model (with a `has_many`, `has_one` or `belongs_to` relationship), nested routes are also created for you. And you don't need to worry about the references/joins, they are done automaticaly!  For example, imagine a `Team` model that has many `User`s ```ruby class Team < ActiveRecord::Base   has_many :users end ```  the following routes will be exposed by the `UsersController` controller: ``` GET /team/:team_id/users ``` ``` GET /team/:team_id/users/:id ``` ``` POST /team/:team_id/users ``` ``` PUT /team/:team_id/users/:id ``` ``` DESTROY /team/:team_id/users/:id ``` "
794,57,https://github.com/squareteam/yodatra,### Note,3,squareteam.yodatra.md,3,"You can disable __any__ of these actions by using the __::disable__ class method and providing the list of actions you want to disable ```ruby class UsersController < Yodatra::ModelsController   disable :read, :update, :delete, :nested_read_all, :nested_delete end ``` "
795,57,https://github.com/squareteam/yodatra,### Extra,3,squareteam.yodatra.md,3,"You can enable a special ""search"" action by using the __::enable_search_on__ class method ```ruby class UsersController < Yodatra::ModelsController   enable_search_on :name end ``` "

Establish a connection with a database by reading the ```<your_project>/config/database.yml``` file  For that create a sinatra app that inherits from ```Yodatra::Base``` instead of ```Sinatra::Base```. 
797,57,https://github.com/squareteam/yodatra,## Other useful modules,3,squareteam.yodatra.md,2," - __Throttling__: To fight against the dark side, an API throttling you will need. Example: allow only 10 requests/minute per IP: ```ruby use Yodatra::Throttle, {:redis_conf => {}, :rpm => 10} ``` _warning: this module requires redis_ - __ApiFormatter__:  this middleware will help you to format all your replies. Example: wrap all you replies within a ```{data: <...>}``` object: ```ruby use Yodatra::ApiFormatter do |status, headers, response|   body = response.empty? ? '' : response.first   response = [{:data => body}]   [status, headers, response] end ```"

820,60,https://github.com/lulupop/sweep,# sweep.js,16,lulupop.sweep.md,1,=====  A JavaScript library for smoother color transitions. Project page lives [here](http://rileyjshaw.com/sweep/). 
821,60,https://github.com/lulupop/sweep,## About,16,lulupop.sweep.md,2, __sweep.js__ is a small JavaScript library (5kb zipped) that enables proper color transitions through the HSL and HUSL spaces. Ordinary CSS transitions or existing frameworks convert HSL colors to RGB _before_ transitioning. __sweep.js__ addresses this by letting you transition through the color spectrum.  I've written an in-depth post about the need for HSL transitions [here](http://rileyjshaw.com/blog/hue-angle-transitions/). 
822,60,https://github.com/lulupop/sweep,## Install,3,lulupop.sweep.md,2," ```.bash bower install -S sweep ```  ...or just [download it from here](https://github.com/rileyjshaw/sweep/blob/master/bin/sweep.min.js).  Sweep's dependencies are bundled; all you have to do is include the script.  ```.html <script src=""path/to/sweep.js""></script> ```  Sweep is wrapped with [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd), so it'll also work as a module in your system of choice. "
823,60,https://github.com/lulupop/sweep,## Usage,3,lulupop.sweep.md,2," Using sweep.js to transition an element's color is easy. Whenever you want to trigger an HSL sweep, call:  ```.js sweep(target, properties, fromColor, toColor[, options]) ```   - `target` - element that you wish to animate  - `properties` - CSS properties that you wish to animate (string or array of strings)  - `fromColor` - initial color before the transition  - `toColor` - final color after the transition  - `options` (optional) - an object that can set the following:    - `callback` - function to be called once the animation finishes    - `direction` - clockwise (1) or counterclockwise (-1)    - `duration` - time (in ms) to complete the animation    - `space` - 'HSL', 'HUSL', or 'RGB' "
824,60,https://github.com/lulupop/sweep,## Examples,35,lulupop.sweep.md,2," Trigger a full color cycle on click:  ```.js //click  var ex1 = document.querySelector('#ex1'); ex1.addEventListener('click', function() {   sweep(ex1, 'backgroundColor', '#a8f', '#a8f', {direction: -1, duration: 2000}); }, false); ```  Animate from purple to green on hover:  ```.js //hover  var ex2 = document.querySelector('#ex2');  ex2.addEventListener('mouseenter', function() {   sweep(ex2, 'backgroundColor', getStyle(ex2, 'background-color'), '#0fa'); }, false);  ex2.addEventListener('mouseleave', function() {   sweep(ex2, 'backgroundColor', getStyle(ex2, 'background-color'), '#a8f'); }, false); ```  Licensed under [MIT](https://github.com/rileyjshaw/sweep/blob/master/LICENSE).

For eg:  ```ruby def second_supply_for_fourth_of_july(holiday_supplies)   holiday_supplies[:summer][:fourth_of_july][1] end ```  * Write a method that adds a supply to both Winter holidays.  * Write a method that adds a supply to Memorial Day.  * Write a method that adds a new holiday and its associated supplies to any season.  * Write a method to collect all Winter supplies from all the winter holidays. For eg:  ```bash winter_supplies(holiday_supplies) #=> [""Lights"", ""Wreath"", etc] ```  * Write a method that uses a loop to list out all the supplies you have for each holiday and the season. Use string manipulation to get your output to match what the test is expecting.  * Here are a few helpful tips:   * Our hash keys are symbols. We need to convert them into strings. Use the `.to_s` method on a symbol to convert it into a string.   * Look closely at the output string that the test is expecting. You'll notice that it expects holiday names, like ""New Years"", to have both words capitalized. Ruby has a `.capitalize` method that you can call on a string. **But, note:**     * `.capitalize` returns the capitalized string but *doesn't change* the original string. So, when you call on that same string in the future, it *isn't capitalized!* You can capitalize a string for now and evermore by using the bang operator (`!`).     * You'll need to capitalize *both words* in a given holiday's name. If you call `""new years"".capitalize!`, it will return `""New years""`. In order to capitalize *both* words, you'll need to `.split` the string into an array and iterate over that array to `.capitalize!` each word in it. Then, you'll need to `.join` the array back into a string.     * If you're unfamiliar with the methods mentioned above, look them up in the Ruby documentation.  Example of expected output:  ``` Winter:   Christmas: Lights, Wreath   New Years: Party Hats ```  * Write a method to collect all holidays with ""BBQ"" in the supply array. The method should behave as seen below:  ```bash holidays_with_bbqs(holiday_supplies)"

His threadpool library is hosted at https://github.com/mbrossard/threadpool. This library is unused (not linked) in a Windows environment.

Since we don't want to distribute the Oracle Code you MUST download the OCI Packages (basic and devel) from the Oracle Website: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/instant-client/index-097480.html.  In order to successfully compile and link 'erloci' you must set the variables <code>""CXXFLAGS""</code> and <code>""DRV_LDFLAGS""</code> in rebar.config.

However this is not required, you can always put the extracted library files into <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>. So if you really need this, here is the way to go:  1. Create the file 'oci.pc' in /usr/lib/pkgconfig (if not present) 2. Copy the library to an appropriate place (e.g. /usr/lib/oracle/) 3. Put the following lines in oci.pci. You may need to modify the path and other info as seem fit for your system  ``` prefix=/usr/lib/oracle/11.2/client exec_prefix=${prefix} libdir=${exec_prefix}/lib includedir=${exec_prefix}/include  Name: oci Description: Oracle OCI client libraries Version: 11.2 Libs: -L${libdir} -lclntsh -lnnz11 -locci Cflags: -I${includedir} ```"

979,76,https://github.com/agomezf/ProgrammingAssignment2,### Introduction,12,agomezf.ProgrammingAssignment2.md,3," This second programming assignment will require you to write an R function that is able to cache potentially time-consuming computations. For example, taking the mean of a numeric vector is typically a fast operation. However, for a very long vector, it may take too long to compute the mean, especially if it has to be computed repeatedly (e.g. in a loop). If the contents of a vector are not changing, it may make sense to cache the value of the mean so that when we need it again, it can be looked up in the cache rather than recomputed. In this Programming Assignment you will take advantage of the scoping rules of the R language and how they can be manipulated to preserve state inside of an R object. "
980,76,https://github.com/agomezf/ProgrammingAssignment2,### Example: Caching the Mean of a Vector,3,agomezf.ProgrammingAssignment2.md,3," In this example we introduce the `<<-` operator which can be used to assign a value to an object in an environment that is different from the current environment. Below are two functions that are used to create a special object that stores a numeric vector and caches its mean.  The first function, `makeVector` creates a special ""vector"", which is really a list containing a function to  1.  set the value of the vector 2.  get the value of the vector 3.  set the value of the mean 4.  get the value of the mean  <!-- -->      makeVector <- function(x = numeric()) {             m <- NULL             set <- function(y) {                     x <<- y                     m <<- NULL             }             get <- function() x             setmean <- function(mean) m <<- mean             getmean <- function() m             list(set = set, get = get,                  setmean = setmean,                  getmean = getmean)     }  The following function calculates the mean of the special ""vector"" created with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the mean has already been calculated. If so, it `get`s the mean from the cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the mean of the data and sets the value of the mean in the cache via the `setmean` function.      cachemean <- function(x, ...) {             m <- x$getmean()             if(!is.null(m)) {                     message(""getting cached data"")                     return(m)             }             data <- x$get()             m <- mean(data, ...)             x$setmean(m)             m     } "
981,76,https://github.com/agomezf/ProgrammingAssignment2,### Assignment: Caching the Inverse of a Matrix,3,agomezf.ProgrammingAssignment2.md,3," Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than computing it repeatedly (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will not discuss here). Your assignment is to write a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.  Write the following functions:  1.  `makeCacheMatrix`: This function creates a special ""matrix"" object     that can cache its inverse. 2.  `cacheSolve`: This function computes the inverse of the special     ""matrix"" returned by `makeCacheMatrix` above. If the inverse has     already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then     `cacheSolve` should retrieve the inverse from the cache.  Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the `solve` function in R. For example, if `X` is a square invertible matrix, then `solve(X)` returns its inverse.  For this assignment, assume that the matrix supplied is always invertible.  In order to complete this assignment, you must do the following:  1.  Fork the GitHub repository containing the stub R files at     [https://github.com/rdpeng/ProgrammingAssignment2](https://github.com/rdpeng/ProgrammingAssignment2)     to create a copy under your own account. 2.  Clone your forked GitHub repository to your computer so that you can     edit the files locally on your own machine. 3.  Edit the R file contained in the git repository and place your     solution in that file (please do not rename the file). 4.  Commit your completed R file into YOUR git repository and push your     git branch to the GitHub repository under your account. 5.  Submit to Coursera the URL to your GitHub repository that contains     the completed R code for the assignment. "

Strings matched by the regular expression, but not found in the encoding map are removed from the output. This allows for example to automatically trim input values (removing whitespace from the start and end of the string):  ```js tmpl.encReg = /(^\s+)|(\s+$)|[<>&""'\x00]/g; var output = tmpl.encode(""    Banana!    ""); // Renders ""Banana"" (without whitespace) ``` "
1013,80,https://github.com/rramona2/JavaScript-Templates,### Local helper variables,36,rramona2.JavaScript-Templates.md,3,"The local variables available inside the templates are the following:  * **o**: The data object given as parameter to the template function (see the next section on how to modify the parameter name). * **tmpl**: A reference to the **tmpl** function object. * **_s**: The string for the rendered result content. * **_e**: A reference to the **tmpl.encode** method. * **print**: Helper function to add content to the rendered result string. * **include**: Helper function to include the return value of a different template in the result.  To introduce additional local helper variables, the string **tmpl.helper** can be extended. The following adds a convenience function for *console.log* and a streaming function, that streams the template rendering result back to the callback argument (note the comma at the beginning of each variable declaration):  ```js tmpl.helper += "",log=function(){console.log.apply(console, arguments)}"" +     "",st='',stream=function(cb){var l=st.length;st=_s;cb( _s.slice(l));}""; ```  Those new helper functions could be used to stream the template contents to the console output:  ```html <script type=""text/x-tmpl"" id=""tmpl-demo""> <h3>{%=o.title%}</h3> {% stream(log); %} <p>Released under the <a href=""{%=o.license.url%}"">{%=o.license.name%}</a>.</p> {% stream(log); %} <h4>Features</h4> <ul> {% stream(log); %} {% for (var i=0; i<o.features.length; i++) { %}     <li>{%=o.features[i]%}</li>     {% stream(log); %} {% } %} </ul> {% stream(log); %} </script> ``` "

The argument name can be modified by overriding **tmpl.arg**:  ```js tmpl.arg = ""p"";  // Renders ""<h3>JavaScript Templates</h3>"": var result = tmpl(""<h3>{%=p.title%}</h3>"", {title: ""JavaScript Templates""}); ``` "
1015,80,https://github.com/rramona2/JavaScript-Templates,### Template parsing,36,rramona2.JavaScript-Templates.md,3,"The template contents are matched and replaced using the regular expression **tmpl.regexp** and the replacement function **tmpl.func**. The replacement function operates based on the [parenthesized submatch strings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace#Specifying_a_function_as_a_parameter).  To use different tags for the template syntax, override **tmpl.regexp** with a modified regular expression, by exchanging all occurrences of ""{%"" and ""%}"", e.g. with ""[%"" and ""%]"":  ```js tmpl.regexp = /([\s'\\])(?!(?:[^[]|\[(?!%))*%\])|(?:\[%(=|#)([\s\S]+?)%\])|(\[%)|(%\])/g; ```  By default, the plugin preserves whitespace (newlines, carriage returns, tabs and spaces). To strip unnecessary whitespace, you can override the **tmpl.func** function, e.g. with the following code:  ```js var originalFunc = tmpl.func; tmpl.func = function (s, p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, offset, str) {     if (p1 && /\s/.test(p1)) {         if (!offset || /\s/.test(str.charAt(offset - 1)) ||                 /^\s+$/g.test(str.slice(offset))) {             return '';         }         return ' ';     }     return originalFunc.apply(tmpl, arguments); }; ``` "

1019,80,https://github.com/rramona2/JavaScript-Templates,## Compiled templates,3,rramona2.JavaScript-Templates.md,2,"The JavaScript Templates project comes with a compilation script, that allows you to compile your templates into JavaScript code and combine them with a minimal Templates runtime into one combined JavaScript file.  The compilation script is built for [node.js](http://nodejs.org/). To use it, first install the JavaScript Templates project via [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/):  ```sh npm install blueimp-tmpl ```  This will put the executable **tmpl.js** into the folder **node_modules/.bin**. It will also make it available on your PATH if you install the package globally (by adding the **-g** flag to the install command).  The **tmpl.js** executable accepts the paths to one or multiple template files as command line arguments and prints the generated JavaScript code to the console output. The following command line shows you how to store the generated code in a new JavaScript file that can be included in your project:  ```sh tmpl.js index.html > tmpl.js ```  The files given as command line arguments to **tmpl.js** can either be pure template files or HTML documents with embedded template script sections. For the pure template files, the file names (without extension) serve as template ids. The generated file can be included in your project as a replacement for the original **tmpl.js** runtime. It provides you with the same API and provides a **tmpl(id, data)** function that accepts the id of one of your templates as first and a data object as optional second parameter. "

You'll notice a few new things in this lesson that we haven't encountered before. Don't worry, we'll walk you through them. "
1025,81,https://github.com/JWood02/javascript-logging-lab-bootcamp-prep-000,### Tests...,3,JWood02.javascript-logging-lab-bootcamp-prep-000.md,3," The first new thing you'll notice is tests.  When we want to run an experiment, we need to develop a hypothesis and we need to test it. So if we want to experiment with whether adding salt to ice water makes it hotter or colder, we need to design an experiment that controls for all of the other variables: we need to _isolate_ our experiment from parts of its environment that aren't relevant to what we hope to test.  In programming, tests place the scientific method into computer science. We run tests to verify that our programs behave the way we think they do. Tests help us identify bugs, and they give us a sense of the health of our applications.  On Learn, we use tests as teaching tools. Just like in a normal coding environment, we use tests to describe the program's behavior. Unlike in a normal coding environment, you, not we, are in charge of getting the tests to pass — that is, making the app behave like we expect it to. "
1026,81,https://github.com/JWood02/javascript-logging-lab-bootcamp-prep-000,### Structure,3,JWood02.javascript-logging-lab-bootcamp-prep-000.md,3," The structure of this lab — where its files and folders are located — looks roughly like the following:  ``` shell ├── CONTRIBUTING.md ├── LICENSE.md ├── README.md ├── index.js ├── node_modules/ ├── package.json └── test     └── index-test.js ```  All labs will more or less have the same structure. (And READMEs, for that matter, will still have CONTRIBUTING.md, LICENSE.md, and README.md files.)  `index.js` might be called something else (something more descriptive) in other labs, and so `test/index-test.js` would be renamed accordingly. But `index.js` is also descriptive in its own right, defining something of an entry point for finding one's way around the app. This is often the file where you will write your code. (Later on, we'll introduce `index.html` and `index.css` — you'll have to update or refer to these files sometimes, too!) "
1027,81,https://github.com/JWood02/javascript-logging-lab-bootcamp-prep-000,### Code-along,3,JWood02.javascript-logging-lab-bootcamp-prep-000.md,3," For now, open up `index.js` in your text editor. If you're using the Learn IDE, click the ""Open"" button on this lesson  ![learn open](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/skills-based-js/learn_open.png)  your IDE should open up. You'll see a sidebar like this:  ![learn IDE sidebar](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/skills-based-js/learn_ide_sidebar.png)  If you open up that ""javascript-logging-lab..."" folder, you'll see a list of files (along with a test/ directory). Click `index.js`, and it will open in the editor.  In `index.js`, you should see, well, nothing. We'll fix that soon.  Now open up `test/index-test.js`. Hey, there's something! What's all of this stuff doing?  At the very top of the file, you'll see  ``` javascript const expect = require('expect') const fs = require('fs') const jsdom = require('mocha-jsdom') const path = require('path') ```  This might be a bit bewildering, but at this point, we don't need to be able to write any of this code, or even understand every line perfectly.  All we need is to understand enough so that we can get a sense of what the test is asking us to accomplish, so that we can make the test pass.  Let's go through it.  In these first lines, all we're doing is referencing different _libraries_ that help us run your tests. A library is code that someone else (usually multiple someone elses) wrote for our use. Note that `require` won't work out of the box in the browser. We're actually running our tests in a different _environment_. (Remember the sandbox analogy from earlier? It's just like that.)  A little farther down the page, you'll see  ``` javascript describe('index', () => {   // there's stuff in here, too }) ```  `describe` is a function provided by our test runner (in this case, we're using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)) — it's basically a container for our tests.  Then we have a few chunks like  ``` javascript it('calls console.error()', () => {   // this is where the tests are! }) ```  Each of these chunks describes a behavior that we expect the main program to implement. As you can see, they describe that behavior pretty carefully — in this example, we know that our main file should call `console.error()` — pretty simple, right?  Don't worry too much yet about what's happening inside these chunks. Sometimes we'll need to do some pretty fancy footwork to test some pretty basic things; other times, and as time goes on, you'll be able to read and understand basically what our tests are expecting.  And that'll be great! These aren't like tests that we all took in school: they're testing behavior, not information. Tests are meant to be as transparent as possible about what they're doing, and as you grow as a programmer, it's important to understand more and more what the aims of tests are.  In some of our tests, you'll see lines like the following:  ``` javascript jsdom({   src: fs.readFileSync(path.resolve(__dirname, '..', 'index.js'), 'utf-8') }) ```  This line reads `index.js` (remember how we said we'd modify that?) and adds its code to the _execution environment_. The ""execution environment"" is simply where our code runs. "
1028,81,https://github.com/JWood02/javascript-logging-lab-bootcamp-prep-000,## Running the Tests,3,JWood02.javascript-logging-lab-bootcamp-prep-000.md,2," To run the tests, simply type `learn test` in the terminal part of the Learn IDE. (The terminal is the part below where you've been coding.) You should see something like  ![failures](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/skills-based-js/console_logging_lab_all_failing.png)  For the moment, all of the tests fail. Let's figure out how to get one of them passing! (The rest will be up to you.)  Let's take the first one. The test description says, ""index calls console.error()"". So it sounds like, pretty straight-forwardly, like we should _call_ `console.error()` somewhere in `index.js`. ""Calling"" a function means invoking it, causing it to act. We call functions with parentheses: `console.error` _is_ a function, but `console.error()` is a _call_ to the function.  In `index.js`, add a call to `console.error()` — you can call it with anything you like (as long as the syntax is valid). We're going to go with  ``` javascript console.error(""HALP!"") ```  Because it seems sufficiently dire. Remember to save your file.  Anyway, let's run the tests again. In the Learn IDE's terminal, run  ``` javascript learn test ```  We should now see:  ![one passing](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/skills-based-js/console_logging_lab_one_passing.png)  Nice! We got the first one to pass! "
1029,81,https://github.com/JWood02/javascript-logging-lab-bootcamp-prep-000,## A note about spies,3,JWood02.javascript-logging-lab-bootcamp-prep-000.md,2," You might often see errors like the ones above: `""Uncaught error: spy was not called""`. Spies are little bits of code that keep track of whether or not they were called. We use them to make sure that a function is called when we expect it to be called.  We'll try to rewrite these error messages when possible to be more descriptive about what kinds of calls we expected; but know that sometimes, especially later on, we leave the errors intentionally ambiguous for you to work out. "
1030,81,https://github.com/JWood02/javascript-logging-lab-bootcamp-prep-000,## Your turn,3,JWood02.javascript-logging-lab-bootcamp-prep-000.md,2," Now it's your turn — can you follow a flow similar to the one we followed together above to get the remaining to tests to pass?  Imagine that you're building the user interface for a fancy ATM machine. Because the developers are hip with the latest trends, they're using JavaScript for the user-facing parts.  We need a way to send messages to the user: some messages are just updates, some are warnings (the user should not continue doing what they just did), and some are errors (something broke, and we need to recover).  Your job is to identify a way of sending each kind of message. Hint: in JavaScript, you'll probably find ways of telling users things with `console`.  And again, remember to save your files before you re-run your tests.  When all of your tests pass, be sure to run `learn submit` to move on to the next lesson. "
1031,81,https://github.com/JWood02/javascript-logging-lab-bootcamp-prep-000,## Feeling stuck?,3,JWood02.javascript-logging-lab-bootcamp-prep-000.md,2," In the above, when we ran our tests and saw the message ""index calls console.error()"", we wrote,  ```javascript console.error(""HALP!"") ```  Now when we run the tests again and see ""index calls console.log()"", we should look at what is the same and what is different between this message and the previous one. It looks like they're basically the same except for one tells us to call `console.error()` and the other tells us to call `console.log()`. So if we got back to `index.js` and write something like,  ```javascript console.log(""I would be a logger."") // get it? ```  we're now calling `console.log()` with a different string.

1053,84,https://github.com/CraigLiaoBJ/ADClusterMapView,# ADClusterMapView - MKMapView with clustering,1,CraigLiaoBJ.ADClusterMapView.md,1, ADClusterMapView is a drop-in subclass of MKMapView that displays and animates clusters of annotations. This is very useful in cases where you have to display many annotations on the map. Concept and implementation were described on Applidium's [website][].  [website]: http://applidium.com/en/news/too_many_pins_on_your_map/ 
1054,84,https://github.com/CraigLiaoBJ/ADClusterMapView,## Quick start,3,CraigLiaoBJ.ADClusterMapView.md,2, 1. Add the content of the ADClusterMapView folder to your iOS project 2. Link against the MapKit and CoreLocation frameworks if you don't already 3. Turn your MKMapView instance into a subclass of ADClusterMapView 4. Set your annotations by calling `setAnnotations:`. Do not use `addAnnotation:` or `addAnnotations:` as they are not supported yet. 
1055,84,https://github.com/CraigLiaoBJ/ADClusterMapView,### ARC,3,CraigLiaoBJ.ADClusterMapView.md,3," If you are not using ARC in your project, add the `-fobjc-arc` flag to the files of the library in the *Build Phases > Compile Sources* section in Xcode. "
1056,84,https://github.com/CraigLiaoBJ/ADClusterMapView,## Displaying custom MKAnnotationView instances,3,CraigLiaoBJ.ADClusterMapView.md,2," In the `mapView:viewForAnnotation:` and `mapView:viewForClusterAnnotation:` implementations of your map view's delegate, you are given an instance of ADClusterAnnotation. You can call `[annotation originalAnnotations]` to retrieve your original `id<MKAnnotation>` instances and customize your `MKAnnotationView` instance like you would do with Map Kit. This is especially useful in the case of a *leaf* annotation, whose `originalAnnotations` array obviously contains one and only one object. "
1057,84,https://github.com/CraigLiaoBJ/ADClusterMapView,### Example code:,3,CraigLiaoBJ.ADClusterMapView.md,3,"```objective-c - (MKAnnotationView *)mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView viewForAnnotation:(id<MKAnnotation>)annotation {     MyAnnotationView * pinView = (MyAnnotationView *)[mapView dequeueReusableAnnotationViewWithIdentifier:@""ADClusterableAnnotation""];     if (!pinView) {         pinView = [[[MyAnnotationView alloc] initWithAnnotation:annotation                                                 reuseIdentifier:@""ADClusterableAnnotation""]                    autorelease];     }     MyModel * model = [annotation originalAnnotations][0];     pinView.image = model.image;     return pinView; } ``` "
1058,84,https://github.com/CraigLiaoBJ/ADClusterMapView,## Optional delegate methods,6,CraigLiaoBJ.ADClusterMapView.md,2, We provide you with a few optional methods that you may want to add to your `ADClusterMapViewDelegate` implementation: 
1059,84,https://github.com/CraigLiaoBJ/ADClusterMapView,### Setting the maximum number of clusters that you want to display at the same time,6,CraigLiaoBJ.ADClusterMapView.md,3, ```objective-c - (NSInteger)numberOfClustersInMapView:(ADClusterMapView *)mapView; // default: 32 ``` 
1060,84,https://github.com/CraigLiaoBJ/ADClusterMapView,### Custom MKAnnotationView instance for clusters,6,CraigLiaoBJ.ADClusterMapView.md,3, ```objective-c - (MKAnnotationView *)mapView:(ADClusterMapView *)mapView viewForClusterAnnotation:(id <MKAnnotation>)annotation; // default: same as returned by mapView:viewForAnnotation: ``` 
1061,84,https://github.com/CraigLiaoBJ/ADClusterMapView,### Custom title for clusters,6,CraigLiaoBJ.ADClusterMapView.md,3," ```objective-c - (NSString *)clusterTitleForMapView:(ADClusterMapView *)mapView; // default : @""%d elements"" ``` "
1062,84,https://github.com/CraigLiaoBJ/ADClusterMapView,### Set visibility for cluster annotation's subtitle,6,CraigLiaoBJ.ADClusterMapView.md,3, ```objective-c - (BOOL)shouldShowSubtitleForClusterAnnotationsInMapView:(ADClusterMapView *)mapView; // default: YES ``` 
1063,84,https://github.com/CraigLiaoBJ/ADClusterMapView,### Disminish outliers weight,6,CraigLiaoBJ.ADClusterMapView.md,3, ```objective-c - (double)clusterDiscriminationPowerForMapView:(ADClusterMapView *)mapView; // This parameter emphasize the discrimination of annotations which are far away from the center of mass. default: 1.0 (no discrimination applied) ``` 
1064,84,https://github.com/CraigLiaoBJ/ADClusterMapView,### Animation callback,6,CraigLiaoBJ.ADClusterMapView.md,3, ```objective-c - (void)clusterAnimationDidStopForMapView:(ADClusterMapView *)mapView; ``` 
1065,84,https://github.com/CraigLiaoBJ/ADClusterMapView,## Future Work,47,CraigLiaoBJ.ADClusterMapView.md,2, There are a couple of improvements that could be done. Feel free to send us pull requests if you want to contribute!  - Add support for annotations addition and removal. - Add support for multiple independant trees - More?
1066,85,https://github.com/Leelow/sinopia,## Use cases,6,Leelow.sinopia.md,2,"`sinopia` - a private/caching npm repository server  [![npm version badge](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/sinopia.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/sinopia) [![travis badge](http://img.shields.io/travis/rlidwka/sinopia.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/rlidwka/sinopia) [![downloads badge](http://img.shields.io/npm/dm/sinopia.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/sinopia)  It allows you to have a local npm registry with zero configuration. You don't have to install and replicate an entire CouchDB database. Sinopia keeps its own small database and, if a package doesn't exist there, it asks npmjs.org for it keeping only those packages you use.  <p align=""center""><img src=""https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/999113/1795553/680177b2-6a1d-11e3-82e1-02193aa4e32e.png""></p>   1. Use private packages.     If you want to use all benefits of npm package system in your company without sending all code to the public, and use your private packages just as easy as public ones.     See [using private packages](#using-private-packages) section for details.  2. Cache npmjs.org registry.     If you have more than one server you want to install packages on, you might want to use this to decrease latency    (presumably ""slow"" npmjs.org will be connected to only once per package/version) and provide limited failover (if npmjs.org is down, we might still find something useful in the cache).     See [using public packages](#using-public-packages-from-npmjsorg) section for details.  3. Override public packages.     If you want to use a modified version of some 3rd-party package (for example, you found a bug, but maintainer didn't accept pull request yet), you can publish your version locally under the same name.     See [override public packages](#override-public-packages) section for details. "

1073,85,https://github.com/Leelow/sinopia,### Docker,6,Leelow.sinopia.md,3, A Sinopia docker image [is available](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/keyvanfatehi/sinopia/) 
1074,85,https://github.com/Leelow/sinopia,### Chef,6,Leelow.sinopia.md,3, A Sinopia Chef cookbook [is available at Opscode community](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/sinopia) source: https://github.com/BarthV/sinopia-cookbook 
1075,85,https://github.com/Leelow/sinopia,### Puppet,6,Leelow.sinopia.md,3, A Sinopia puppet module [is available at puppet forge](http://forge.puppetlabs.com/saheba/sinopia) source: https://github.com/saheba/puppet-sinopia 
1076,85,https://github.com/Leelow/sinopia,## Configuration,3,Leelow.sinopia.md,2," When you start a server, it auto-creates a config file. "
1077,85,https://github.com/Leelow/sinopia,## Adding a new user,3,Leelow.sinopia.md,2, ```bash npm adduser --registry http://localhost:4873/ ```  This will prompt you for user credentials which will be saved on the Sinopia server. 
1078,85,https://github.com/Leelow/sinopia,## Using private packages,3,Leelow.sinopia.md,2," You can add users and manage which users can access which packages.  It is recommended that you define a prefix for your private packages, for example ""local"", so all your private things will look like this: `local-foo`. This way you can clearly separate public packages from private ones. "
1079,85,https://github.com/Leelow/sinopia,## Using public packages from npmjs.org,3,Leelow.sinopia.md,2," If some package doesn't exist in the storage, server will try to fetch it from npmjs.org. If npmjs.org is down, it serves packages from cache pretending that no other packages exist. Sinopia will download only what's needed (= requested by clients), and this information will be cached, so if client will ask the same thing second time, it can be served without asking npmjs.org for it.  Example: if you successfully request express@3.0.1 from this server once, you'll able to do that again (with all it's dependencies) anytime even if npmjs.org is down. But say express@3.0.0 will not be downloaded until it's actually needed by somebody. And if npmjs.org is offline, this server would say that only express@3.0.1 (= only what's in the cache) is published, but nothing else. "
1080,85,https://github.com/Leelow/sinopia,## Override public packages,3,Leelow.sinopia.md,2," If you want to use a modified version of some public package `foo`, you can just publish it to your local server, so when your type `npm install foo`, it'll consider installing your version.  There's two options here:  1. You want to create a separate fork and stop synchronizing with public version.     If you want to do that, you should modify your configuration file so sinopia won't make requests regarding this package to npmjs anymore. Add a separate entry for this package to *config.yaml* and remove `npmjs` from `proxy_access` list and restart the server.     When you publish your package locally, you should probably start with version string higher than existing one, so it won't conflict with existing package in the cache.  2. You want to temporarily use your version, but return to public one as soon as it's updated.     In order to avoid version conflicts, you should use a custom pre-release suffix of the next patch version. For example, if a public package has version 0.1.2, you can upload 0.1.3-my-temp-fix. This way your package will be used until its original maintainer updates his public package to 0.1.3. "
1081,85,https://github.com/Leelow/sinopia,## Compatibility,1,Leelow.sinopia.md,2," Sinopia aims to support all features of a standard npm client that make sense to support in private repository. Unfortunately, it isn't always possible.  Basic features:  - Installing packages (npm install, npm upgrade, etc.) - supported - Publishing packages (npm publish) - supported  Advanced package control:  - Unpublishing packages (npm unpublish) - supported - Tagging (npm tag) - not yet supported, should be soon - Deprecation (npm deprecate) - not supported  User management:  - Registering new users (npm adduser {newuser}) - supported - Transferring ownership (npm owner add {user} {pkg}) - not supported, sinopia uses its own acl management system  Misc stuff:  - Searching (npm search) - supported in the browser client but not command line - Starring (npm star, npm unstar) - not supported, doesn't make sense in private registry "
1082,85,https://github.com/Leelow/sinopia,## Storage,3,Leelow.sinopia.md,2," No CouchDB here. This application is supposed to work with zero configuration, so filesystem is used as a storage.  If you want to use a database instead, ask for it, we'll come up with some kind of a plugin system. "
1083,85,https://github.com/Leelow/sinopia,## Similar existing things,6,Leelow.sinopia.md,2," - npm + git (I mean, using git+ssh:// dependencies) - most people seem to use this, but it's a terrible idea... *npm update* doesn't work, can't use git subdirectories this way, etc. - [reggie](https://github.com/mbrevoort/node-reggie) - this looks very interesting indeed... I might borrow some code there. - [shadow-npm](https://github.com/dominictarr/shadow-npm), [public service](http://shadow-npm.net/) - it uses the same code as npmjs.org + service is dead - [gemfury](http://www.gemfury.com/l/npm-registry) and others - those are closed-source cloud services, and I'm not in a mood to trust my private code to somebody (security through obscurity yeah!) - npm-registry-proxy, npm-delegate, npm-proxy - those are just proxies... - Is there something else?

The following rules will be used for the CTR process:   * a committer can go ahead and commit the patch without mandatory review if     felt confident in its quality (e.g. reasonable testing has been done     locally; all compilations pass; RAT check is passed; the patch follows     coding guidelines)   * a committer is encouraged to seek peer-review and/or advice before hand if     there're doubts in the approach taken, design decision, or implementation     details   * a committer should keep an eye on the official CI builds at     http://ci.bigtop.apache.org/job/Bigtop-trunk/ (Bigtop-trunk-packages builds)     to make sure that committed changes haven't break anything. In     which case the committer should take a timely effort to resolve the issues     and unblock the others in the community   * any non-document patch is required to be opened for at least 24 hours for     community feedback before it gets committed unless it has an explicit +1     from another committer   * any non-document patch needs to address all the comment and reach consensus     before it gets committed without a +1 from other committers   * there's no changes in the JIRA process, except as specified above "
1094,87,https://github.com/ganeshraju/bigtop,# What do people use Apache Bigtop for?,2,ganeshraju.bigtop.md,1,"==============================  You can go to the [Apache Bigtop website](http://bigtop.apache.org/) for notes on how to do ""common"" tasks like:    * Apache Hadoop App developers: Download an Apache Bigtop built Apache Hadoop 2.0 VM from the website, so you can have a running psuedodistributed Apache Hadoop cluster to test your code on.   * Cluster administers or deployment gurus: Run the Apache Bigtop smoke tests to ensure that your cluster is working.   * Vendors: Build your own Apache Hadoop distribution, customized from Apache Bigtop bits. "
1095,87,https://github.com/ganeshraju/bigtop,# Getting Started,3,ganeshraju.bigtop.md,1,"===============  Below are some recipes for getting started with using Apache Bigtop. As Apache Bigtop has different subprojects, these recipes will continue to evolve. For specific questions it's always a good idea to ping the mailing list at dev-subscribe@bigtop.apache.org to get some immediate feedback, or [open a JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BIGTOP). "
1096,87,https://github.com/ganeshraju/bigtop,## For Users: Running the smoke tests.,3,ganeshraju.bigtop.md,2,"-----------------------------------  The simplest way to test bigtop is described in bigtop-tests/smoke-tests/README file  For integration (API level) testing with maven, read on. "
1097,87,https://github.com/ganeshraju/bigtop,## For Users: Running the integration tests.,3,ganeshraju.bigtop.md,2,"-----------------------------------------  WARNING: since testing packages requires installing them on a live system it is highly recommended to use VMs for that. Testing Apache Bigtop is done using iTest framework. The tests are organized in maven submodules, with one submodule per Apache Bigtop component.  The bigtop-tests/test-execution/smokes/pom.xml defines all submodules to be tested, and each submodule is in its own directory under smokes/, for example:  *smokes/hadoop/pom.xml* *smokes/hive/pom.xml* *... and so on.*  * New way (with Gradle build in place)   * Step 1: install smoke tests for one or more components     * Example 1:          gradle installTestArtifacts      * Example 2: Installing just Hadoop-specific smoke tests          gradle install-hadoop    * Step 2: Run the the smoke tests on your cluster (see Step 3 and/or Step 4 below)    We are on the route of migrating subprojects under top-level gradle build. Currently   converted projects could be listed by running          gradle projects    To see the list of tasks in a subproject, ie itest-common, you can run          gradle itest-common:tasks  * Old Way   * Step 1: Build the smokes with snapshots.  This ensures that all transitive dependencies etc.. are in your repo          mvn clean install -DskipTests -DskipITs -DperformRelease -f ./bigtop-test-framework/pom.xml         mvn clean install -DskipTests -DskipITs -DperformRelease -f ./test-artifacts/pom.xml    * Step 2: Now, rebuild in ""offline"" mode.  This will make sure that your local changes to bigtop are embeded in the changes.          mvn clean install -DskipTests -DskipITs -DperformRelease -o -nsu -f ./bigtop-test-framework/pom.xml         mvn clean install -DskipTests -DskipITs -DperformRelease -o -nsu -f ./bigtop-tests/test-artifacts/pom.xml    * Step 3: Now, you can run the smoke tests on your cluster.     * Example 1: Running all the smoke tests with TRACE level logging (shows std out from each mr job).              mvn clean verify -Dorg.apache.bigtop.itest.log4j.level=TRACE -f ./bigtop/bigtop-tests/test-execution/smokes/pom.xml      * Just running hadoop examples, nothing else.              mvn clean verify -D'org.apache.maven-failsafe-plugin.testInclude=**/*TestHadoopExamples*' -f bigtop-tests/test-execution/smokes/hadoop/pom.xml      Note: A minor bug/issue: you need the ""testInclude"" regular expression above, even if you don't want to customize the tests,     since existing test names don't follow the maven integration test naming convention of IT*, but instead, follow the surefire (unit test) convention of Test*.

1098,87,https://github.com/ganeshraju/bigtop,## For Users: Creating Your Own Apache Hadoop Environment,3,ganeshraju.bigtop.md,2,"-----------------------------------------------  Another common use case for Apache Bigtop is creating / setting up your own Apache Hadoop distribution. For details on this, check out the bigtop-deploy/README.md file, which describes how to use the puppet repos to create and setup your VMs. There is a current effort underway to create vagrant/docker recipes as well, which will be contained in the bigtop-deploy/ package.  "
1099,87,https://github.com/ganeshraju/bigtop,## For Developers: Building the entire distribution from scratch,3,ganeshraju.bigtop.md,2,"-------------------------------------------------------------  Packages have been built for CentOS/RHEL 5 and 6, Fedora 18, SuSE Linux Enterprise 11, OpenSUSE12.2, Ubuntu LTS Lucid and Precise, and Ubuntu Quantal. They can probably be built for other platforms as well. Some of the binary artifacts might be compatible with other closely related distributions.  __On all systems, Building Apache Bigtop requires certain set of tools__    To bootstrap the development environment from scratch execute      ./gradlew toolchain    This build task expected Puppet 3.x to be installed; user has to have sudo permissions. The task will pull down and install   all development dependencies, frameworks and SDKs, required to build the stack on your platform.  * __Building packages__ : `gradle [component-name]-[rpm|deb]`    If -Dbuildwithdeps=true is set, the Gradle will follow the order of the build specified in   the ""dependencies"" section of bigtop.bom file. Otherwise just a single component will get build (original behavior).    To use an alternative definition of a stack composition (aka BOM), specify its   name with -Dbomfile=<filename> system property in the build time.    You can visualize all tasks dependencies by running `gradle tasks --all` * __Building local YUM/APT repositories__ : `gradle [component-name]-[yum|apt]`  * __Recommended build environments__    Bigtop provides ""development in the can"" environments, using Docker containers.   These have the build tools set by the toolchain, as well as the user and build   environment configured and cached. All currently supported OSes could be pulled   from official Bigtop repository at https://hub.docker.com/r/bigtop/slaves/tags/    To build a component (bigtop-groovy) for a particular OS (ubuntu-14.04) you can   run the following from a clone of Bigtop workspace (assuming your system has   Docker engine setup and working)   ```docker run --rm -u jenkins:jenkins -v `pwd`:/ws --workdir /ws bigtop/slaves:trunk-ubuntu-14.04   bash -l -c './gradlew allclean ; ./gradlew bigtop-groovy-pkg'``` "

1101,87,https://github.com/ganeshraju/bigtop,## For Developers: Building a component from Git repository,3,ganeshraju.bigtop.md,2,"--------------------------------------------------------  To fetch source from a Git repository you need to modify `bigtop.mk` and add the following fields to your package:  * `_GIT_REPO` - SSH, HTTP or local path to Git repo. * `_GIT_REF` - branch, tag or commit hash to check out.  Some packages have different names for source directory and source tarball (`hbase-0.98.5-src.tar.gz` contains `hbase-0.98.5` directory). By default source will be fetched in a directory named `_TARBALL_SRC` without `.t*` extension. To explicitly set directory name use the `_GIT_DIR` option.  Example for HBase:   ```make HBASE_GIT_REPO=https://github.com/apache/hbase.git HBASE_GIT_REF=$(HBASE_PKG_VERSION) HBASE_GIT_DIR=hbase-$(HBASE_PKG_VERSION) ```  "

1109,89,https://github.com/jmilleralpine/ParallelGit,## Project purpose explained,2,jmilleralpine.ParallelGit.md,2,"------------------------- Git is an awesome data storage. Its special data structure offers many useful features such as:  * Keeping history snapshots at a very low cost * Automatic duplication detection * Remote backup * Merging and conflict resolution  Git is well known and widely used as a VCS, yet few software application uses Git as a internal data storage. One of the reasons is the lack of high level API to efficiently communicate with a Git repository.  Consider the workflow in software development, the standard steps to make changes to Git repository are:  ``` Checkout (branch/commit) ==> Write file ==> Add file to index ==> Commit ```  While this model works sufficiently well with developers, it does not fit in the architecture diagram of a server role application. Reasons are:  * Only one branch can be checked out at a time * Checking out a branch is a heavy I/O task as files need to be deleted and re-created on hard drive * Every context switching needs a check out  There are ways around these problems, but they usually involve manual blob and tree creations, which are verbose and error prone.  ParallelGit is a layer between application logic and Git. It abstracts away Git's low level object manipulation details and provides a friendly interface which extends the Java 7 NIO filesystem API. The filesystem itself operates in memory with data pulled from hard drive on demand.  With ParallelGit an application can control a Git repository as it were a normal filesystem. Arbitrary branch and commit can be checked out at the minimal CPU and I/O cost. Multiple filesystem instances can be hosted simultaneously with no interference.  "
1110,89,https://github.com/jmilleralpine/ParallelGit,## Performance explained,13,jmilleralpine.ParallelGit.md,2,"--------------------- Git is best at storing changes in many small batches. It is very rare to have a commit that updates all files in a repository. The size of I/O per request is usually very small compared to the size of the repository. Pre-loading everything into memory is usually an overkill for most tasks.  To minimise I/O and memory usage, ParallelGit loads the minimum necessary data to complete a request. Consider a scenario where a branch has the file tree below: ``` ├──app-core │   └──src │       ├──main │       │   ├──MyFactory.java │       │   └──MyProduct.java │       └──test │           └──ProductionTest.java └──app-web     ├──index.html     └──style.css ``` When this branch is checked out. The information of its head commit is loaded into memory. That includes the author and committer details, the commit message and the reference to the root node of this file tree. This reference is a 40-char hash, which can be used to find the tree object representing the root directory.  Assuming the task requires the content of `/app-core/src/main/MyFactory.java`, before this file can be reached, its parent directories (including the root directory) need to be resolved i.e: ``` 1) / 2) /app-core 3) /app-core/src 4) /app-core/src/main ``` The last directory (`/app-core/src/main`) represented by a Git tree object has the reference to the blob of `MyFactory.java`. This reference is another 40-char hash value that can be used to find the byte array data of this file in constant time.  Now let's say you want to read the file `/app-core/src/main/MyProduct.java`. This file is in the same directory as the previous one. There is no need to read the directories again as they are already in memory. This time we simply read the blob reference from `/app-core/src/main` and use it to retrieve the content of the file.  Saving files to repository follows a similar pattern. Assuming you have made a change to `MyFactory.java` and you want to commit this change. ParallelGit saves the file as a blob and creates the new tree objects from bottom-up i.e: ``` 1) /app-core/src/main 2) /app-core/src 3) /app-core 4) / ```  The whole process above involved 2 out of the total 5 files in the branch, and ParallelGit only focuses on reaching the 2 files. The existence of the other 3 files causes (nearly) zero impact to the performance. Your repository can keep on growing and your request handling time remains constant.  "

Our projects increasingly require sliders to be touch-friendly, have clear value displays, provide adjustable min/max 'stops', use higher-order output transformations (e.g. exponential curves), and format their value in different ways (e.g. as %, $, or other units).

1155,95,https://github.com/peppy6582/serviceLogs,## Before You Begin,6,peppy6582.serviceLogs.md,2,"[![MEAN.JS Logo](http://meanjs.org/img/logo-small.png)](http://meanjs.org/)  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/meanjs/mean.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/meanjs/mean) [![Dependencies Status](https://david-dm.org/meanjs/mean.svg)](https://david-dm.org/meanjs/mean)  MEAN.JS is a full-stack JavaScript open-source solution, which provides a solid starting point for [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) based applications. The idea is to solve the common issues with connecting those frameworks, build a robust framework to support daily development needs, and help developers use better practices while working with popular JavaScript components.  Before you begin we recommend you read about the basic building blocks that assemble a MEAN.JS application: * MongoDB - Go through [MongoDB Official Website](http://mongodb.org/) and proceed to their [Official Manual](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/), which should help you understand NoSQL and MongoDB better. * Express - The best way to understand express is through its [Official Website](http://expressjs.com/), which has a [Getting Started](http://expressjs.com/starter/installing.html) guide, as well as an [ExpressJS Guide](http://expressjs.com/guide/error-handling.html) guide for general express topics. You can also go through this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8144214/learning-express-for-node-js) for more resources. * AngularJS - Angular's [Official Website](http://angularjs.org/) is a great starting point. You can also use [Thinkster Popular Guide](http://www.thinkster.io/), and the [Egghead Videos](https://egghead.io/). * Node.js - Start by going through [Node.js Official Website](http://nodejs.org/) and this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2353818/how-do-i-get-started-with-node-js), which should get you going with the Node.js platform in no time.  "
1156,95,https://github.com/peppy6582/serviceLogs,## Prerequisites,3,peppy6582.serviceLogs.md,2,"Make sure you have installed all these prerequisites on your development machine. * Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/download/) and the npm package manager, if you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js. * MongoDB - [Download & Install MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads), and make sure it's running on the default port (27017). * Bower - You're going to use the [Bower Package Manager](http://bower.io/) to manage your front-end packages, in order to install it make sure you've installed Node.js and npm, then install bower globally using npm:  ``` $ npm install -g bower ```  * Grunt - You're going to use the [Grunt Task Runner](http://gruntjs.com/) to automate your development process, in order to install it make sure you've installed Node.js and npm, then install grunt globally using npm:  ``` $ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli ``` "
1157,95,https://github.com/peppy6582/serviceLogs,## Downloading MEAN.JS,3,peppy6582.serviceLogs.md,2,There are several ways you can get the MEAN.JS boilerplate: 
1158,95,https://github.com/peppy6582/serviceLogs,### Yo Generator,3,peppy6582.serviceLogs.md,3,The recommended way would be to use the [Official Yo Generator](http://meanjs.org/generator.html) which will generate the latest stable copy of the MEAN.JS boilerplate and supplies multiple sub-generators to ease your daily development cycles. 
1159,95,https://github.com/peppy6582/serviceLogs,### Cloning The GitHub Repository,3,peppy6582.serviceLogs.md,3,You can also use Git to directly clone the MEAN.JS repository: ``` $ git clone https://github.com/meanjs/mean.git meanjs ``` This will clone the latest version of the MEAN.JS repository to a **meanjs** folder. 
1160,95,https://github.com/peppy6582/serviceLogs,### Downloading The Repository Zip File,3,peppy6582.serviceLogs.md,3,Another way to use the MEAN.JS boilerplate is to download a zip copy from the [master branch on GitHub](https://github.com/meanjs/mean/archive/master.zip). You can also do this using `wget` command: ``` $ wget https://github.com/meanjs/mean/archive/master.zip -O meanjs.zip; unzip meanjs.zip; rm meanjs.zip ``` Don't forget to rename **mean-master** after your project name. 
1161,95,https://github.com/peppy6582/serviceLogs,## Quick Install,3,peppy6582.serviceLogs.md,2,"Once you've downloaded the boilerplate and installed all the prerequisites, you're just a few steps away from starting to develop you MEAN application.  The first thing you should do is install the Node.js dependencies. The boilerplate comes pre-bundled with a package.json file that contains the list of modules you need to start your application, to learn more about the modules installed visit the NPM & Package.json section.  To install Node.js dependencies you're going to use npm again, in the application folder run this in the command-line:  ``` $ npm install ```  This command does a few things: * First it will install the dependencies needed for the application to run. * If you're running in a development environment, it will then also install development dependencies needed for testing and running your application. * Finally, when the install process is over, npm will initiate a bower install command to install all the front-end modules needed for the application "
1162,95,https://github.com/peppy6582/serviceLogs,## Running Your Application,3,peppy6582.serviceLogs.md,2,"After the install process is over, you'll be able to run your application using Grunt, just run grunt default task:  ``` $ grunt ```  Your application should run on the 3000 port so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)  That's it! your application should be running by now, to proceed with your development check the other sections in this documentation. If you encounter any problem try the Troubleshooting section. "
1163,95,https://github.com/peppy6582/serviceLogs,## Development and deployment With Docker,3,peppy6582.serviceLogs.md,2, * Install [Docker](http://www.docker.com/) * Install [Fig](https://github.com/orchardup/fig)  * Local development and testing with fig: ```bash $ fig up ```  * Local development and testing with just Docker: ```bash $ docker build -t mean . $ docker run -p 27017:27017 -d --name db mongo $ docker run -p 3000:3000 --link db:db_1 mean $ ```  * To enable live reload forward 35729 port and mount /app and /public as volumes: ```bash $ docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 35729:35729 -v /Users/mdl/workspace/mean-stack/mean/public:/home/mean/public -v /Users/mdl/workspace/mean-stack/mean/app:/home/mean/app --link db:db_1 mean ``` 
1164,95,https://github.com/peppy6582/serviceLogs,## Running in a secure environment,3,peppy6582.serviceLogs.md,2,To run your application in a secure manner you'll need to use OpenSSL and generate a set of self-signed certificates. Unix-based users can use the following commnad: ``` $ sh generate-ssl-certs.sh ``` Windows users can follow instructions found [here](http://www.websense.com/support/article/kbarticle/How-to-use-OpenSSL-and-Microsoft-Certification-Authority) To generate the key and certificate and place them in the *config/sslcert* folder. 
1165,95,https://github.com/peppy6582/serviceLogs,## Getting Started With MEAN.JS,36,peppy6582.serviceLogs.md,2,"You have your application running but there are a lot of stuff to understand, we recommend you'll go over the [Official Documentation](http://meanjs.org/docs.html). In the docs we'll try to explain both general concepts of MEAN components and give you some guidelines to help you improve your development process. We tried covering as many aspects as possible, and will keep update it by your request, you can also help us develop the documentation better by checking out the *gh-pages* branch of this repository.

1171,96,https://github.com/petrjanda/ICDM2015,# Instalation:,3,petrjanda.ICDM2015.md,1,============  This software is implemented in python and uses the external software XGBoost.  The libraries of python needed are:  - [Numpy] (http://www.numpy.org/)  - [Scipy] (http://www.scipy.org/)  - [SciKit Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/)  XGBoost software can be downloaded from: XGBoost: https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost In this challenge we used the version 0.3.  
1172,96,https://github.com/petrjanda/ICDM2015,# Settings:,3,petrjanda.ICDM2015.md,1,"=========  This software contains two setting files:  'Variables.py' contains the environment variables that the software needs:   * There is an environment variable for the absolute path of every file provided in the challenge.  * There is an environment variable for the python wrapper folder of XGBoost.  * There is an environment variable for the path to save/load the model.  'VariablesTST.py' contains two environment variables:   * There is an environment variable for the absolute path of the test file.  * There is an environment variable for the absolute path of the file with the results to submit to kaggle.  Edit 'Variables.py' and 'VariablesTST.py' and use the values of you files and the path that contains the wrapper of your installation of XGBoost.  The procedure 'train.py' makes use of 'Variable.py' The procedure 'test.py' makes use of 'Variable.py' and 'VariableTST.py' (it uses Variable.py because the model has very big data structures that is more practical to load again from the training files than saving and loading again, if you want to evaluate your model in a different test file than the one provided for the challenge uses the variable ""testfile"" in 'Variables.py' for the original test file provided by Drawbridge and the variable ""predictFile"" in 'VariablesTST.py' for the file that you wish to evaluate).

1174,96,https://github.com/petrjanda/ICDM2015,# Running the code:,3,petrjanda.ICDM2015.md,1,=================  To train the algorithm and create the model:      python train.py  To use the model and make the predictions on a test file:      python predict.py  
1175,96,https://github.com/petrjanda/ICDM2015,# Description of the algorithm:,3,petrjanda.ICDM2015.md,1,"=============================  * Preprocessing At the initial stage, we iterate over the list of cookies looking for other cookies with the same handle. Then, for every pair of cookies with the same handle, if one of them doesn't appear in an IP address that the other cookie appears, we include all the information about this IP address in the cookie.  * Initial selection of candidate cookies for every Device: It is not possible to create a training set containing every combination of devices and cookies due to the high number of them. In order to reduce the initial complexity of the problem and to create an affordable dataset, some basic rules have been created to obtain an initial reduced set of candidate cookies for every device. The rules are based on the IP addresses that both device and cookie have in common and how frequent they are in other devices and cookies. The procedure, for every device, is as follows.    1. We create a set that contains the device's IP addresses that appear in less than ten devices and less than twenty cookies. The initial list of candidates is every cookie with known handle that appears in any of theses IP addresses.   1. If the previous rule returned an empty set of candidates we create a set that contains the device's IP addresses that appear in less than twenty five devices and less than fifty cookies. The initial list of candidates is every with known handle cookie that appears in any of theses IP addresses.   1. If the previous rule returned an empty set of candidates we create a set that contains the device's IP addresses. The initial list of candidates is every cookie with known handle that appears in any of theses IP addresses.   1. If the previous rule returned an empty set of candidates we create a set that contains the device's IP addresses. The initial list of candidates is every cookie that appears in any of theses IP addresses.   1. If a cookie has the same handle than any of the candidates then this cookie is a candidate too.  * Creating the datasets: Every pattern in the training and test set represents a device/candidate cookie pair obtained by the previous step and contains information about the device (Operating System (OS), Country, ...), the cookie (Cookie Browser Version, Cookie Computer OS,...) and the relation between them (number of IP addresses shared by both device and cookie, number of other cookies with the same handle than the cookie,...).  * Training procedure (Supervised Learning + Bagging) To create the classifier, we have selected a Regularized Boosted Trees algorithm. The software that we used was XGBoost. We have used 8 baggers creating 8 different subdatasets from the original dataset.  * Semi Supervised Learning: Semi-supervised learning is a class of supervised learning that also make use of unlabeled data. In our case we make use of the data contained in the test set. If we sort the scores obtained by every candidate and the first score is high and the second is very low, is very likely that the first cookie belongs to the device. We make use of this information to update some features in the training set and retrain the algorithm again.  * PostProcessing: We iterate over the devices using the following procedure: If the initial selection of candidates did not find a candidate with enough likelihood (logistic output of the classifier) we choose a new set of candidate cookies selecting every cookie that shares an IP address with the device and we score them using the classifier. We label the cookie with highest score as one of the device's cookies. If there are other cookies with the same handle than this cookie we label them too. We sort the candidates in descending order by the score they have reached and we iterate over them. We label them as a device's cookie if they reach a threshold. The value of the threshold changes attending to:  The number of cookies already labeled as device's cookies.  The number of other cookies with the same handle than this one.  The handle of the cookie is known or not.  The of the best candidate is known or not. "

If this set is empty we include every IP address visited by both device and cookie.  * setOtherDevices: This set contains every device of the training set with the same handle than the cookie except by the device of this pattern.  * setOtherIP: This set contains the IP addresses visited by any device in setOtherCookies.  * setOtherP roperties: This set contains the properties visited by any device in setOtherCookies.  Using these sets we have created the following features:   * Number of IP addresses visited by both device and cookie.  * Number of IP addresses that appear in less than ten devices and less than twenty cookies visited by both device and cookie.  * Number of devices in setOtherDevices  * Number of IP addresses that the device has in common with setOtherIP.  * Number of Properties that the device has in common with setOtherP roperties.  * Number of cookies with the same handle than this cookie.  * Addition of features IsCell, Total Frequency, Count C0, Count C1 and Count C2 of every IP address in setIP.  * Average of features IsCell, Total Frequency, Count C0, Count C1 and Count C2 of every IP address in setIP.  * Addition of features Frequency Count, Count 1, Count 2, Count 3, Count 4 and Count 5 of the device’s IP addresses in setIP.  * Average of features Frequency Count, Count 1, Count 2, Count 3, Count 4 and Count 5 of the device’s IP addresses in setIP.  * Addition of features Frequency Count, Count 1, Count 2, Count 3, Count 4 and Count 5 of the cookie’s IP addresses in setIP.  * Average of features Frequency Count, Count 1, Count 2, Count 3, Count 4 and Count 5 of the cookie’s IP addresses in setIP.  * Addition of features Frequency Count, Count 1, Count 2, Count 3, Count 4 and Count 5 of the device’s IP addresses in setIP minus addition of features Frequency Count, Count 1, Count 2, Count 3, Count 4 and Count 5 of the cookie’s IP addresses in setIP.

1196,99,https://github.com/pombredanne/pyqver,## INTRODUCTION,1,pombredanne.pyqver.md,2," This script attempts to identify the minimum version of Python that is required to execute a particular source file.  When developing Python scripts for distribution, it is desirable to identify which minimum version of the Python interpreter is required. `pyqver` attempts to answer this question using a simplistic analysis of the output of the Python compiler.  When run without the `-v` argument, sources are listed along with the minimum version of Python required. When run with the `-v` option, each version is listed along with the reasons why that version is required. For example, for the `pyqver2.py` script itself:      pyqver2.py             2.3     platform  This means that `pyqver2.py` uses the `platform` module, which is a 2.3 feature.  The `pyqver2.py` script is specific to Python 2.x, and `pyqver3.py` is specific to Python 3.x.  This script was inspired by the following question on Stack Overflow: [Tool to determine what lowest version of Python required?][1]    [1]: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/804538/tool-to-determine-what-lowest-version-of-python-required "
1197,99,https://github.com/pombredanne/pyqver,## REQUIREMENTS,3,pombredanne.pyqver.md,2, This script requires at least Python 2.3.

For example, the 2.6 syntax      try:         # ...     except Exception as x:         # ...  is not detected because the output of the `compiler` module is the same for both the old and the new syntax.

RGenGC reduces marking time dramatically (about x10 faster). However, RGenGC introduce huge memory consumption. This problem has impact especially for small memory machines.  Ruby 2.1.1 introduced new environment variable RUBY_GC_HEAP_OLDOBJECT_LIMIT_FACTOR to control full GC timing. By setting this variable to a value lower than the default of 2 (we are using the suggested value of 1.3) you can indirectly force the garbage collector to perform more major GCs, which reduces heap growth.  ```sh $ heroku config:set RUBY_GC_HEAP_OLDOBJECT_LIMIT_FACTOR=1.3 ```  More information: [Change the full GC timing](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/9607) "

The API also works with the free [GeoLite2 databases](http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/).  See [GeoIP2::WebService::Client](https://metacpan.org/pod/GeoIP2::WebService::Client) for details on the web service client API and [GeoIP2::Database::Reader](https://metacpan.org/pod/GeoIP2::Database::Reader) for the database API. 
1238,103,https://github.com/MrItty/GeoIP2-perl,# SPEEDING UP DATABASE READING,36,MrItty.GeoIP2-perl.md,1," This module only depends on the pure Perl implementation of the MaxMind database reader ([MaxMind::DB::Reader](https://metacpan.org/pod/MaxMind::DB::Reader)).

They offer both free and paid premium data. Each feature is uniquely identified by a `geoname_id`, which is an integer.  Many of the records returned by the GeoIP web services and databases include a `geoname_id` field. This is the ID of a geographical feature (city, region, country, etc.) in the GeoNames database.  Some of the data that MaxMind provides is also sourced from GeoNames. We source data such as place names, ISO codes, and other similar data from the GeoNames premium data set. "
1241,103,https://github.com/MrItty/GeoIP2-perl,# REPORTING DATA PROBLEMS,56,MrItty.GeoIP2-perl.md,1," If the problem you find is that an IP address is incorrectly mapped, please submit your correction to MaxMind at [http://www.maxmind.com/en/correction](http://www.maxmind.com/en/correction).  If you find some other sort of mistake, like an incorrect spelling, please check the GeoNames site ([http://www.geonames.org/](http://www.geonames.org/)) first. Once you've searched for a place and found it on the GeoNames map view, there are a number of links you can use to correct data (""move"", ""edit"", ""alternate names"", etc.). Once the correction is part of the GeoNames data set, it will be automatically incorporated into future MaxMind releases.  If you are a paying MaxMind customer and you're not sure where to submit a correction, please contact MaxMind support at for help.

1251,104,https://github.com/nmjesus/sharedb,## Data model,6,nmjesus.sharedb.md,2," In ShareDB's view of the world, every document has 3 properties:  - **version** - An incrementing number starting at 0 - **type** - An OT type. OT types are defined in [share/ottypes](https://github.com/share/ottypes). Documents which don't exist implicitly have a type of `null`. - **data** - The actual data that the document contains. This must be pure acyclic JSON. Its also type-specific. (JSON type uses raw JSON, text documents use a string, etc).  ShareDB implicitly has a record for every document you can access. New documents have version 0, a null type and no data. To use a document, you must first submit a *create operation*, which will set the document's type and give it initial data. Then you can submit editing operations on the document (using OT). Finally you can delete the document with a delete operation. By default, ShareDB stores all operations forever - nothing is truly deleted.  "
1252,104,https://github.com/nmjesus/sharedb,## Operations,6,nmjesus.sharedb.md,2, See https://github.com/ottypes/json0 for documentation of the supported operations.   <!-- Old docs from LiveDB: 
1253,104,https://github.com/nmjesus/sharedb,## Using ShareDB,-,nmjesus.sharedb.md,2,
1254,104,https://github.com/nmjesus/sharedb,### Creating documents,-,nmjesus.sharedb.md,3," To create a document, you need to submit a create operation to the document to set its type. In sharedb's world, a document doesn't exist until it has a type set.  A create operation looks like this: `{create:{type:TYPE, [data:INITIAL DATA]}, [v:VERSION]}`. The type should be something accessible in the map returned by require('ottypes'), for example `json0` or `http://sharejs.org/types/textv1`. Specifying initial data is optional. If provided, it is passed to the type's `create()` method. This does what you expect - for JSON documents, pass your initial object here. For text documents, pass a string containing the document's contents. As with all operations, the version is optional. You probably don't want to specify the version for a create message.  To submit any changes to documents, you use `sharedb.submit(cName, docName, opData, callback)`.  For example:  ```javascript sharedb.submit('users', 'fred', {create:{type:'json0', data:[1,2,3]}}, function(err, version, transformedByOps, snapshot) {   // I made a document, ma! }); ```  Since documents implicitly exist with no type at version 0, usually the create message will increment the version from 0 to 1. Not all documents you want to delete have a version of 0 - if a document is deleted, it will retain its version. "
1255,104,https://github.com/nmjesus/sharedb,### Deleting documents,-,nmjesus.sharedb.md,3," Deleting documents is similar to creating them. A deleted document has no type and no data, but will retain its version (actually, the delete operation will bump the document's version). A delete operation looks like this: `{del:true, [v:VERSION]}`.  You use the same submit function as above to delete documents:  ```javascript sharedb.submit('users', 'fred', {del:true}, function(err) {   //goneskies! Kapow! }); ``` "
1256,104,https://github.com/nmjesus/sharedb,### Editing documents,-,nmjesus.sharedb.md,3," You edit a document by submitting an operation. Operations are OT type-specific JSON blobs. Refer to the documentation on the particular OT type for details. For example, text documents are documented [here](https://github.com/share/ottypes/blob/master/lib/text.js#L10-L16). If we had a text document stored in LiveDB and wanted to edit it, it might look like this:  ```javascript sharedb.submit('love letters', 'dear fred', {op:[6, ""You never return my calls!""], v:1002}, function(err) {   // ... }); ```  You should always specify the version when submitting edit operations. The version is technically optional - if its missing, your operation will be submitted against the most recent version of the document in the server. This is useful for creating a document which may already exist, but for normal edits you should always specify the expected current version of the document.  "
1257,104,https://github.com/nmjesus/sharedb,### Getting a document,-,nmjesus.sharedb.md,3," You can fetch the most recent version of a document using `sharedb.fetch(cName, docName, callback)` or `sharedb.bulkFetch(request, callback)`. This will fetch the document(s) from the snapshot database and fetch all operations which may or may not have been committed.  Fetch returns a snapshot data object via its callback. The snapshot data object has the following fields:  - **v:** version. This is an integer (starting at 0) containing the version of the document - **type:** Document type, if set. This field is missing if the document does not exist. - **data:** The document's actual data. For JSON documents this is a JSON tree.   For text documents this is a string. This field is missing if the document does not exist.  ```javascript sharedb.fetch('users', 'fred', function(err, snapshot) {   // snapshot has {v:123, type:'...', data:{name:'Fred Flintstone'}}   // If the document doesn't exist, only the v:version field will exist in the data. }); ```  If you need to get many documents, its more efficient to issue bulk fetches. To pass the set of requested documents to bulkFetch, you need to make a request object which maps collection names to lists of documents you want in that collection. For example, to get 'red', 'green' and 'blue' from the colors collection, you would make a bulkFetch request of `{colors:['red', 'green', 'blue']}`.  The response maps each collection name to a set of snapshots. Each set of snapshots maps document names to snapshot data objects. Continuing our colors example above, the response could be `{colors:{red:{v:0}, green:{v:10, type:..., data:""emerald""}, blue:{v:1, type:..., data:{favorite:true}}}}`.  For example:  ```javascript sharedb.bulkFetch({users:['fred', 'wilma', 'homer'], admins:['zerocool']}, function(err, results) {   // results will be {users:{fred:..., wilma:..., homer:...}, admins:{zerocool:...}}.   // Each document has v and optional type and data fields like fetch (above). }); ```  "
1258,104,https://github.com/nmjesus/sharedb,### Getting historic changes to a document,-,nmjesus.sharedb.md,3," You can get old versions of a document (for playback or catching up a client) using `sharedb.getOps(cName, docName, from, to, callback)`. This will return all operations which have been applied to the named document in the requested range. The range is *open*, so `getOps('users', 'fred', 0, 3, ..)` will return all operations up to (but not including) 3. (Ie, operations 0, 1 and 2).  If you set the *to* field to null, getOps will get all operations up to the current version.  ShareDB documents always start at version 0, so you can get a document's entire history using `getOps('users', fred', 0, null, callback);`.  If you set *to* to a version in the future, behaviour is not defined.  Example usage:  ```javascript sharedb.submit('users', 'fred', {create:{type:'json0', data:{name:'Fred'}}}, function(err) {   sharedb.submit('users', 'fred', {v:1, op:[{p:['name', 4], si:' Flintstone'}]}, function(err) {     // ...   }); });  // Sometime later...  sharedb.getOps('users', 'fred', 0, null, function(err, ops) {   // ops contains the two operations which were submitted above:   // [{v:0, create:{...}, {v:1, op:[...]}] }); ``` "
1259,104,https://github.com/nmjesus/sharedb,### Streaming changes to a document in realtime,-,nmjesus.sharedb.md,3," You can subscribe to changes from a document using `sharedb.subscribe(cName, docName, v, callback)` or `sharedb.bulkSubscribe(request, callback)`. When you subscribe, you get an operation stream which gets packed with operations as they happen.  When you subscribe to a document, you need to specify which version you're subscribing to the document *from*. The version cannot be in the future.  The stream will be populated with each operation from the requested version onwards (to infinity and beyond). Each operation will appear in the stream exactly once. If you subscribe and request an old document version, all operations from that version to the current version will be buffered in the stream before the stream is returned to the callback.  You usually want to call *subscribe* after fetching a document. Pass the document version that you got from calling *fetch* into your call to *subscribe*.  For example:  ```javascript sharedb.fetch('users', 'fred', function(err, data) {   if (err) { ... }   var version = data.v;    // ... Any amount of time later (literally).   sharedb.subscribe('users', 'fred', version, function(err, stream) {     if (err) { ... }      // stream is a nodejs ReadableStream with all operations that happen to     // users.fred.      stream.on('data', function(opData) {       // The opData is a JSON object, the same object you can pass to submit().       // It always has a v: field.        // ShareDB exports a helper function to apply the operation to some       // snapshot data:       var err = ldb.ot.apply(data, opData);       if (err) { ... }     });   }); }); ```  **Important!** To avoid leaking memory, when you're done with a stream call `stream.destroy()` to clean it up.  There is a helper method which will both fetch and subscribe for you (cleverly called `fetchAndSubscribe(cName, docName, callback)`). It is defined like this:  ```javascript ShareDB.prototype.fetchAndSubscribe = function(cName, docName, callback) {   var self = this;   this.fetch(cName, docName, function(err, data) {     if (err) return callback(err);     self.subscribe(cName, docName, data.v, function(err, stream) {       callback(err, data, stream);     });   }); }; ```  It calls your callback with `(err, snapshot, stream)`, giving you both the current document snapshot and the stream of operations from the current version. "
1260,104,https://github.com/nmjesus/sharedb,#### Bulk Subscribe,-,nmjesus.sharedb.md,4," If you want to subscribe to multiple documents at once, you should call `bulkSubscribe(request, callback)`. The bulk subscribe request is a map from cName -> map from docName -> version. For example, `{colors: {red:5, blue:6, green:0}}`. The response is a map from cName -> map from docName -> stream. For example, `{colors: {red:<stream>, blue:<stream>, green:<stream>}}`. bulkSubscribe will either return a stream for all requested objects or (if there was an error), none of them.  Again, remember to call `stream.destroy()` on all streams returned by bulk subscribe when you're done with them.  "
1261,104,https://github.com/nmjesus/sharedb,### Queries,-,nmjesus.sharedb.md,3," ShareDB supports running live queries against the database. It can re-run queries when it suspects that a query's results might have changed - and notify the caller with any changes to the result set.  This is incredibly inefficient and I want to completely rewrite / rework them. For now, I recommend against using live bound queries in a production app with a decent load. I'll document them when I'm happier with them.  "
1262,104,https://github.com/nmjesus/sharedb,### Projections,-,nmjesus.sharedb.md,3," ShareDB supports exposing a *projection* of a real collection, with a specified (limited) set of allowed fields. Once configured, the projected collection looks just like a real collection - except documents only have the fields you've requested.  Operations (gets, queries, sets, etc) on the fake collection work, but you only see a small portion of the data. You can use this to drop server & db load dramatically and speed up page times. Its similar to SQL VIEWs. For now, this only works on JSON documents. (I don't know what it would look like for text documents).  For example, you could make a `users_limited` projection which lets users view each other's names and profile pictures, but not password hashes. You would configure this by calling:  ```javascript sharedb.addProjection('users_limited', 'users', 'json0', {name:true, profileUrl:true}); ```  However, be aware that on its own **this is not sufficient for access control**. If users are still allowed to make arbitrary mongo queries against the projected collection, they can find out any data in the hidden fields.  Configure a projection by calling `addProjection(projCName, realCName, type, fields)`.  - **projCName:** The projected collection name. (Eg, `users_limited`) - **realCName:** The underlying collection name - **type:** The OT type. Only JSON0 is supported for now. - **fields:** A map of the allowed fields in documents. The keys in this map   represent the field names, and the values should be `true`.  Limitations:  - You can only whitelist fields (not blacklist them). - Projections can only limit / allow fields at the top level of the document "
1263,104,https://github.com/nmjesus/sharedb,## Error codes,-,nmjesus.sharedb.md,2," ShareDB returns errors as plain JavaScript objects with the format: ``` {   code: 5000,   message: 'ShareDB internal error' } ```  Additional fields may be added to the error object for debugging context depending on the error. Common additional fields include `collection`, `id`, and `op`. "

It contains the example code and solutions to the exercises in my O'Reilly book [Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do):  [![book](http://akamaicovers.oreilly.com/images/0636920052289/cat.gif)](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do)  Simply open the [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks you are interested in:  * Using [jupyter.org's notebook viewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/index.ipynb)     * note: [github.com's notebook viewer](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/index.ipynb) also works but it is slower and the math formulas are not displayed correctly, * or by cloning this repository and running Jupyter locally. This option lets you play around with the code. In this case, follow the installation instructions below. "
1316,110,https://github.com/ZahoreczTibor/handson-ml,# Installation,3,ZahoreczTibor.handson-ml.md,1," First, you will need to install [git](https://git-scm.com/), if you don't have it already.  Next, clone this repository by opening a terminal and typing the following commands:      $ cd $HOME  # or any other development directory you prefer     $ git clone https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml.git     $ cd handson-ml  If you want to go through chapter 16 on Reinforcement Learning, you will need to [install OpenAI gym](https://gym.openai.com/docs) and its dependencies for Atari simulations.  If you are familiar with Python and you know how to install Python libraries, go ahead and install the libraries listed in `requirements.txt` and jump to the [Starting Jupyter](#starting-jupyter) section. If you need detailed instructions, please read on. "
1317,110,https://github.com/ZahoreczTibor/handson-ml,## Python & Required Libraries,3,ZahoreczTibor.handson-ml.md,2,"Of course, you obviously need Python. Python 2 is already preinstalled on most systems nowadays, and sometimes even Python 3. You can check which version(s) you have by typing the following commands:      $ python --version   # for Python 2     $ python3 --version  # for Python 3  Any Python 3 version should be fine, preferably ≥3.5. If you don't have Python 3, I recommend installing it (Python ≥2.6 should work, but it is deprecated so Python 3 is preferable). To do so, you have several options: on Windows or MacOSX, you can just download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). On MacOSX, you can alternatively use [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) or [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). On Linux, unless you know what you are doing, you should use your system's packaging system. For example, on Debian or Ubuntu, type:      $ sudo apt-get update     $ sudo apt-get install python3  Another option is to download and install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). This is a package that includes both Python and many scientific libraries. You should prefer the Python 3 version.  If you choose to use Anaconda, read the next section, or else jump to the [Using pip](#using-pip) section. "
1318,110,https://github.com/ZahoreczTibor/handson-ml,## Using Anaconda,3,ZahoreczTibor.handson-ml.md,2,"When using Anaconda, you can optionally create an isolated Python environment dedicated to this project. This is recommended as it makes it possible to have a different environment for each project (e.g. one for this project), with potentially different libraries and library versions:      $ conda create -n mlbook python=3.5 anaconda     $ source activate mlbook  This creates a fresh Python 3.5 environment called `mlbook` (you can change the name if you want to), and it activates it. This environment contains all the scientific libraries that come with Anaconda. This includes all the libraries we will need (NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Jupyter and a few others), except for TensorFlow, so let's install it:      $ conda install -n mlbook -c conda-forge tensorflow=1.0.0  This installs TensorFlow 1.0.0 in the `mlbook` environment (fetching it from the `conda-forge` repository). If you chose not to create an `mlbook` environment, then just remove the `-n mlbook` option.  Next, you can optionally install Jupyter extensions. These are useful to have nice tables of contents in the notebooks, but they are not required.      $ conda install -n mlbook -c conda-forge jupyter_contrib_nbextensions  You are all set! Next, jump to the [Starting Jupyter](#starting-jupyter) section. "
1319,110,https://github.com/ZahoreczTibor/handson-ml,## Using pip,3,ZahoreczTibor.handson-ml.md,2,"If you are not using Anaconda, you need to install several scientific Python libraries that are necessary for this project, in particular NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Jupyter and TensorFlow (and a few others). For this, you can either use Python's integrated packaging system, pip, or you may prefer to use your system's own packaging system (if available, e.g. on Linux, or on MacOSX when using MacPorts or Homebrew). The advantage of using pip is that it is easy to create multiple isolated Python environments with different libraries and different library versions (e.g. one environment for each project). The advantage of using your system's packaging system is that there is less risk of having conflicts between your Python libraries and your system's other packages. Since I have many projects with different library requirements, I prefer to use pip with isolated environments.  These are the commands you need to type in a terminal if you want to use pip to install the required libraries. Note: in all the following commands, if you chose to use Python 2 rather than Python 3, you must replace `pip3` with `pip`, and `python3` with `python`.  First you need to make sure you have the latest version of pip installed:      $ pip3 install --user --upgrade pip  The `--user` option will install the latest version of pip only for the current user. If you prefer to install it system wide (i.e. for all users), you must have administrator rights (e.g. use `sudo pip3` instead of `pip3` on Linux), and you should remove the `--user` option. The same is true of the command below that uses the `--user` option.  Next, you can optionally create an isolated environment. This is recommended as it makes it possible to have a different environment for each project (e.g. one for this project), with potentially very different libraries, and different versions:      $ pip3 install --user --upgrade virtualenv     $ virtualenv -p `which python3` env  This creates a new directory called `env` in the current directory, containing an isolated Python environment based on Python 3. If you installed multiple versions of Python 3 on your system, you can replace `` `which python3` `` with the path to the Python executable you prefer to use.  Now you must activate this environment. You will need to run this command every time you want to use this environment.      $ source ./env/bin/activate  Next, use pip to install the required python packages. If you are not using virtualenv, you should add the `--user` option (alternatively you could install the libraries system-wide, but this will probably require administrator rights, e.g. using `sudo pip3` instead of `pip3` on Linux).      $ pip3 install --upgrade -r requirements.txt  Great! You're all set, you just need to start Jupyter now. "
1320,110,https://github.com/ZahoreczTibor/handson-ml,## Starting Jupyter,3,ZahoreczTibor.handson-ml.md,2,"If you want to use the Jupyter extensions (optional, they are mainly useful to have nice tables of contents), you first need to install them:      $ jupyter contrib nbextension install --user  Then you can activate an extension, such as the Table of Contents (2) extension:      $ jupyter nbextension enable toc2/main  Okay! You can now start Jupyter, simply type:      $ jupyter notebook  This should open up your browser, and you should see Jupyter's tree view, with the contents of the current directory. If your browser does not open automatically, visit [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888/tree). Click on `index.ipynb` to get started!

"
1345,112,https://github.com/ammarx/ARP-spoofing,# Requirements,3,ammarx.ARP-spoofing.md,1," For this attack to be performed, you need the following tools to be installed on the machine you will be performing this attacking from: ``` * Python 2.7.6 * Scapy 2.2.0 * Nmap 6.40 * Wireshark * This python script ``` "
1346,112,https://github.com/ammarx/ARP-spoofing,# Requirement details,3,ammarx.ARP-spoofing.md,1," Python comes installed on ubuntu by default.  You can get Scapy from the Ubuntu Software Center: ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ammarx/ARP-spoofing/master/res/1.png)  You can also get Nmap from the Ubuntu Software Center: ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ammarx/ARP-spoofing/master/res/2.png)  Wireshark is also available on the Ubuntu Software Center, however I recommend getting the latest version from the website: ``` https://www.wireshark.org/download.html ``` "
1347,112,https://github.com/ammarx/ARP-spoofing,# Installation,3,ammarx.ARP-spoofing.md,1, You can download this python script by running the following command in the terminal: ``` $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ammarx/ARP-spoofing/master/src/mmattack.py ``` 
1348,112,https://github.com/ammarx/ARP-spoofing,# Setting up IP Forwarding,3,ammarx.ARP-spoofing.md,1," We will be using this script to perform man in the middle attack. Which means we will use this to get the data from another device connected to the same network.  The first step you have to do it turn on the ip forwarding. This step is required so that the connection on the victim's device does not get interrupted.  To turn on IP forwarding, open terminal and type: ``` $ sudo nano '/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward' ```  This will open up the ip_forward file. The default value in it should be `0`, change it to `1` and then save and exit. ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ammarx/ARP-spoofing/master/res/3.png)  Now that we have that sorted, we need to get the MAC address and the IP address of the victim we want to attack on our network. To do that, you first need to see what IP address the router has given you. On Ubuntu you can get that info by going to the Connection Information menu: ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ammarx/ARP-spoofing/master/res/4.png) "
1349,112,https://github.com/ammarx/ARP-spoofing,# Gathering MAC and IP addresses,3,ammarx.ARP-spoofing.md,1," According to this we are connected on IP Address: `192.168.20.230` and the Route IP is: `192.168.20.1` Now here is where a things get a bit tricky because you need a bit of technical knowledge of how IPs work. I wont be going into full details, however I will explain the part that is required for this script to work.  In the above image, you also can see that our Subnet Mask is: `255.255.255.0` The `0` in the above simply means that that block `1-254` is available to the client, while the rest of the blocks are available to the host.  Now keep that in mind and look at this image below: ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ammarx/ARP-spoofing/master/res/subnetting_c.png)  As you can see the Mask length for the `255.255.255.0` is `24`, you can calculate this yourself by converting the Subnet Mask into binary and then counting all the ones. Example: `255.255.255.0` into binary: `1111 1111 . 1111 1111 . 1111 1111 . 0000 0000` So the number of ones are `24`. Now you might be wondering why we need this number? Well this is required for the next step, which is to get the MAC addresses and the IP addresses of everyone connected to your network.  Open up the terminal and type:  ``` $ sudo nmap -sP {Route IP with ending octate as zero}/{this magical number you got in the previous step} ```  Here is mine: ``` $ sudo nmap -sP 192.168.20.0/24 ```  You should see something like this after it is done scanning your network: ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ammarx/ARP-spoofing/master/res/5.png) "
1350,112,https://github.com/ammarx/ARP-spoofing,# Performing the attack,3,ammarx.ARP-spoofing.md,1," Now that you have gotten the IP address and the MAC address of the victim, all you need to do is launch the actual attack. To do that fire up the script you downloaded. ``` $ sudo python '/home/**[computer name]**/mmattack.py' ```  Now all you need to do is enter the details it asks. Here is an example of what it should look like: ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ammarx/ARP-spoofing/master/res/6.png)  If everything goes well, you should be able to start sending packets. ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ammarx/ARP-spoofing/master/res/7.png)  Now while this ARP request is being spammed, we need to open wireshark ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ammarx/ARP-spoofing/master/res/8.png)  Select the proper interface you are connected to. If you are not sure, select the `any` option and click start.  You should see a screen like this now: ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ammarx/ARP-spoofing/master/res/9.png)  With the `ARP` protocol requests getting spammed. If you don't see this, you have done something wrong.  Now to see what the victim is browsing, you can type the following in the filter: ``` ip.addr=={ipaddress_of_the_victim} and http.request ```  > Note: This filter allows you to see the http traffic only. If you want to look at other traffic, I recommend you learn how to use wireshark as this will help you to snoop around more easily. Because the IP address of the victim is `192.168.20.240` for me, I will type the following in the filter: ``` ip.addr==192.168.20.240 and http.request ```  and press enter.  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ammarx/ARP-spoofing/master/res/10.png)  As you see from the image above, the victim is on an android device and is browsing the website `www.tagcraftmc.com`  This sort of attack should work on any network that uses ARP request to get the device details.

1356,113,https://github.com/RodrigoCm95/ionic-native,### Angular 1,3,RodrigoCm95.ionic-native.md,3," Ionic Native works as a stand-in for [ngCordova](http://ngcordova.com/). In many cases, the usage is identical, but we import `ionic.native` instead of `ngCordova` as our module.  As a rule of thumb: take the ES6 class name of the plugin and add `$cordova` to get the service name. For example, `Geolocation` would be `$cordovaGeolocation`, and `Camera` will be `$cordovaCamera`:  ```javascript angular.module('myApp', ['ionic', 'ionic.native'])  .controller('MyCtrl', function($scope, $cordovaCamera) {   $scope.takePicture = function() {     $cordovaCamera.getPicture(opts).then(function(p) {     }, function(err) {     });   }; }); ```  For services that return observables, the Angular 1 digest cycle must be done manually (currently):  ```javascript angular.module('myApp', ['ionic', 'ionic.native'])  .controller('MyCtrl', function($scope, $cordovaGeolocation) {   $scope.takePicture = function() {     $cordovaGeolocation.watchPosition(opts).subscribe(function(p) {       $scope.$apply(function() {         $scope.position = p.coords;       });     }, function(err) {     });   }; }); ``` "

1378,115,https://github.com/fstudio/cstring,# cstring_buffer,-,fstudio.cstring.md,1," 不要直接定义 cstring_buffer 类型，而应该用 CSTRING_BUFFER(var) 声明，它相当于声明了一个名为 var 的 cstring_buffer 对象。  cstring_buffer 位于栈上，通常不需要回收。但是在函数结束时，应该使用 CSTRING_CLOSE(var) 关闭它。  新声明的 cstring_buffer 对象是一个空字符串，可以用下面两个 api 修改它。  ```C cstring cstring_cat(cstring_buffer sb, const char * str); cstring cstring_printf(cstring_buffer sb, const char * format, ...); ``` "
1379,115,https://github.com/fstudio/cstring,# cstring,-,fstudio.cstring.md,1," 如果需要把字符串做参数传递，就应该使用 cstring 类型，而不是 cstring_buffer 类型。CSTRING(var) 可以把 var 这个 cstring_buffer 对象，转换为 cstring 类型。  但是，在对 cstring_buffer 对象做新的操作后，这个 cstring 可能无效。所以每次传递 cstring_buffer 内的值，最好都重新用 CSTRING 宏取一次。  函数调用的参数以及返回值，都应该使用 cstring 类型。如果 cstring 是由外部传入的，无法确定它的数据在栈上还是堆上，所以不能长期持有。如果需要把 cstring 保存在数据结构中，可以使用这对 API : ```C cstring cstring_grab(cstring s); void cstring_release(cstring s); ```  把 cstring 转化为标准的 const char * ，只需要用 s->cstr 即可。  cstring 的比较操作以及 hash 操作都比 const char * 廉价，所以，请使用以下 API : ```C int cstring_equal(cstring a, cstring b); uint32_t cstring_hash(cstring s); ``` "

1393,118,https://github.com/ChadLactaoen/Blackjack,## Rules,3,ChadLactaoen.Blackjack.md,2,"Here are the current rules that are enforced by the blackjack server: * Two Deck Blackjack * Blackjack Pays 3:2 * Support for up to 4 players * Cut Card with ~70% Penetration * Players start with $1000 in chips * If you lose all your money, you are done * Bet increments of $10 with no upper betting limit * Dealer Stands on Soft 17 * No Insurance * Surrender Allowed on First Two Cards (including after splitting) * Dealer Peeks for Blackjack * Aces Split Only Once * Split up to Four Hands (except Aces) * Double After Splitting Allowed (except Aces) "
1394,118,https://github.com/ChadLactaoen/Blackjack,## Subscriptions,3,ChadLactaoen.Blackjack.md,2," WebSockets allow for two-way communication between the server and clients. When a message is received by the server from any clients, it will send back a response to different subscription destinations. The most important message destinations are described below:  * `/topic/game` The main destination for all game info. Any messages sent from here is broadcasted to all clients currently connected to the server. Messages sent to this destination will usually be triggered from clients sending their bets and players sending their actions. * `/queue/player` Messages sent here are only sent to the client that sent a message to an endpoint on the server whose message destination is here. This will be especially important to listen to when your client first registers to play blackjack. During registration, you'll be assigned a secret playerId which is sent to only you, and you'll need to keep track of this playerId to perform any actions and play any hands. * `/queue/errors` If your client sent an invalid message (such as betting when a hand is already in progress or attempting an invalid action on a hand), an error code and an error message will be sent to this queue, which is only sent to the offending client. You may want to consider handling various errors in case your client commits an invalid message. Any unhandled errors committed by your client will hold up the game and could result in a disqualification of the hand or even the game. Possible error messages will be discussed in a later section.

There should only be one hand per player unless they performed a split.         * The `result` in each `hand` object is null if the hand is currently in progress. After the hand is over and the hand is evaluated, it'll either be `WIN`, `PUSH`, or `LOSE`         * The `handStatus` field in each `hand` object represents the current status of the hand. It is `IN_PLAY` if the hand has not busted, `BUST` if the hand value is over 21, `BLACKJACK` if you were dealt a blackjack, and `SURRENDER` if you decided to surrender for half your bet.         * `turn` is a boolean that determines if it's that hand's turn to be acted on.     * `betInForNextRound` is a boolean that will be set to `false` if a hand is currently in progress. This is used during a betting round to determine if that player has placed a bet for the upcoming hand, in which case, would be set to `true`. * `dealer` will be null if the hand is in progress as it holds information on what cards are in the dealer's hand. During the hand, you can refer to the `dealerUpCard` field to see what his top card is. After everyone has acted on their hand, the `dealer` object will be present with information about the dealer and his hand, and the game status will then change to `BETTING_ROUND` * `gameStatus` This will either be `HAND_IN_PROGRESS` or `BETTING_ROUND`. During the betting round, you can place bets. During a hand, only actions on the current hand to act will be accepted. "

The entire list of errors is encompassed in the `BlackjackErrorCode.java` file. For convenience, here's a list of what each error code means and why you may have gotten the error.  * BJ1xx - Error codes in the 100's represent betting errors     * `BJ101` - The bet amount being sent is more than what the player can afford     * `BJ102` - You've already made a bet for the current hand     * `BJ105` - You can't place a bet at this time because there is already a hand in progress     * `BJ110` - Bet must be in increments of 10 * BJ5xx - Error codes in the 500's represent player errors     * `BJ500` - The game is at max capacity and cannot register another player     * `BJ550` - Unable to process an action due to an invalid player id     * `BJ570` - Unable to place a bet because the player's status is currently Inactive. It is only sent to Inactive by the admin, and can only be switched back to Active by an admin * BJ7xx - Error codes in the 700's represent in-game action errors     * `BJ700` - You send an action for a hand, but it is the betting round     * `BJ701` - The hand number you want to act on does not exist for the given player     * `BJ720` - You attempted to double down on a hand that was not eligible for a double down     * `BJ730` - You attempted to surrender a hand that was not eligible for a surrender     * `BJ740` - You attempted to split a hand that was not eligible for a split     * `BJ799` - You are attempting to act on a hand when it is not your turn to act * BJ9xx - Error codes in the 900's are reserved for the Trebek admin panel and should never be sent to clients. If you see an error in the 900's, you're probably accessing endpoints you shouldn't be hitting "
1411,118,https://github.com/ChadLactaoen/Blackjack,## What is Trebek?,6,ChadLactaoen.Blackjack.md,2," While perusing the source code for the Blackjack server, you may notice references to Trebek and might be wondering what it is in the first place. Trebek is the admin panel for the blackjack server that has access to override hands and kick players out of the game. The endpoints and logic is intentionally left out of Git since it should only be used by those administering the exercise (although if you're resourceful enough, you could find these endpoints and use them, but please don't). Any illegal use of Trebek could result in disqualification. If you are administrating the Blackjack server and need the source code for the Trebek panel, please contact Chad Tomas. "
1412,118,https://github.com/ChadLactaoen/Blackjack,## Final Thoughts,6,ChadLactaoen.Blackjack.md,2," Depending on time at the end of the exercise, the idea would be to have four clients at a time going up against each other for a certain number of hands or a certain amount of time. At the end of the given time, the two highest earning clients in that session advance to the next round. The process will repeat until we have 4 clients left, and the highest earner in that final session wins. Note: Winning does not guarantee an internship, but it could be taken into consideration, so try your best.  As far as blackjack strategy goes, take advantage of the internet and any other sources you can get your hands on in the allotted time. As a hint, you should consider looking into implementing basic strategy once your client can play the game. Then if there's time, you might even look into card counting and betting strategies. If you're reading this and writing a client, chances are you're a potential intern candidate. Meaning you're probably in Vegas. There will be people in the room who live and breathe blackjack including myself, so feel free to ask questions on strategy or programming.  With all that being said, the server is not fool-proof. It was written by one engineer in the span of a week. Meaning, things haven't been fully tested and may have sparse documentation due to time constraints. So, if you look hard enough, you may find some loop holes in the source code that might give you an advantage in one way or another. Use whatever you can to gain an advantage, but also consider the ethics of the situation before doing anything that could critically make the game less fun for everyone else.  If you have any questions regarding the project, feel free to contact me. And lastly... "

1427,119,https://github.com/imkernel/cockroach,### Overview,16,imkernel.cockroach.md,3,"CockroachDB is a distributed SQL database built on top of a transactional and consistent key:value store. The primary design goals are support for ACID transactions, horizontal scalability and survivability, hence the name. CockroachDB implements a Raft consensus algorithm for consistency. It aims to tolerate disk, machine, rack, and even datacenter failures with minimal latency disruption and no manual intervention. CockroachDB nodes (RoachNodes) are symmetric; a design goal is homogeneous deployment (one binary) with minimal configuration.  CockroachDB implements a single, monolithic sorted map from key to value where both keys and values are byte strings (not unicode). CockroachDB scales linearly (theoretically up to 4 exabytes (4E) of logical data). The map is composed of one or more ranges and each range is backed by data stored in [RocksDB][0] (a variant of [LevelDB][1]), and is replicated to a total of three or more CockroachDB servers. Ranges are defined by start and end keys. Ranges are merged and split to maintain total byte size within a globally configurable min/max size interval. Range sizes default to target 64M in order to facilitate quick splits and merges and to distribute load at hotspots within a key range. Range replicas are intended to be located in disparate datacenters for survivability (e.g. `{ US-East, US-West, Japan }`, `{ Ireland, US-East, US-West}` , `{ Ireland, US-East, US-West, Japan, Australia }`).  Single mutations to ranges are mediated via an instance of a distributed consensus algorithm to ensure consistency. We’ve chosen to use the [Raft consensus algorithm][2]. All consensus state is stored in [RocksDB][0].  A single logical mutation may affect multiple key/value pairs. Logical mutations have ACID transactional semantics. If all keys affected by a logical mutation fall within the same range, atomicity and consistency are guaranteed by [Raft][2]; this is the fast commit path. Otherwise, a non-locking distributed commit protocol is employed between affected ranges.  CockroachDB provides snapshot isolation (SI) and serializable snapshot isolation (SSI) semantics, allowing externally consistent, lock-free reads and writes--both from an historical snapshot timestamp and from the current wall clock time. SI provides lock-free reads and writes but still allows write skew. SSI eliminates write skew, but introduces a performance hit in the case of a contentious system. SSI is the default isolation; clients must consciously decide to trade correctness for performance. CockroachDB implements a limited form of linearalizability, providing ordering for any observer or chain of observers.  Similar to [Spanner][3] directories, CockroachDB allows configuration of arbitrary zones of data. This allows replication factor, storage device type, and/or datacenter location to be chosen to optimize performance and/or availability. Unlike Spanner, zones are monolithic and don’t allow movement of fine grained data on the level of entity groups. "

You can:  -   safely ignore the ""*Failed to load resource: net::ERR\_FILE\_NOT\_FOUND*""     error message  or  -   comment out this script line if you will not be converting your project into     a Cordova app that uses Cordova APIs.  The `cordova.js` script will be needed if you choose to convert your project to a *Cordova project* and enhance your app with Cordova APIs. It is not required to build a *Cordova packaged web app* for distribution via the Android, iOS and Windows stores *if that app does not utilize Cordova APIs*.  This blank template does not require any Cordova APIs. If you would like to add Cordova APIs to your application (via Cordova plugins) you must first convert your project into a Cordova project. You can do this by clicking the Cordova icon in the *Project Info* section on the **Projects** tab. Or, you can create a new Cordova project using a Cordova blank template or a Cordova demo or sample app as a starting point."

If you've never contributed to an open source project before I'm more than happy to walk you through how to create a pull request.  You can start by [opening an issue](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/issues/new) describing the problem that you're looking to resolve and we'll go from there.  I want to keep Jekyll Now as minimal as possible. Every line of code should be one that's useful to 90% of the people using it. Please bear that in mind when submitting feature requests.

Landscape is forced because I'm sick of looking at css this evening. Below is the QuickGrapher README. GuickGrapher git - https://github.com/huntergdavis/Quick-Grapher  QuickGrapher.com was one of the research projects spun out of Discursive Labs.   One of the most promising projects we worked on, it always felt like a project without an intended audience, but it never really lifted off.  I'm quite proud of the work that Mark and I did, and think it's a tremendously cool project.  You can use it to embed graphs of any equation within a webpage as easily as a single tag.  You can use it to solve complex equations, functions, etc.  It runs completely in client side Javascript and doesn't require a web connection. it runs on mobile and desktop platforms.  It can display hundreds of thousands of data points and adjust them in real-time.  And now it's open source, BSD licensed, and ready for you to use to escape the tyrannical grasp of Wolfram Alpha.

With Q, a designated host can create a room in which other users can join. In this room, users and the host can collaborate on a playlist by searching for songs on Soundcloud and adding them to a playlist queue. The host has the ability to play, pause, skip, and delete songs on the playlist. Audio is only played through the hosts computer or device. You and the people around you can all use Q's server to search for music and manage the playlist together in REAL-TIME. "

1446,123,https://github.com/choreographing-quokka/Q,## Usage,3,choreographing-quokka.Q.md,2,"    For Q to work properly, a designated host needs to login by clicking 'CREATE ROOM' on the login page and entering 'test' as the password. The host also needs to login before any other user adds a song to the queue; this is a known issue and flawed feature. Users who are not the host must click 'ENTER ROOM' to join the host's room.      Multiple rooms for different hosts is a feature that has not yet been developed. Ideally, a host should be able to create a room which will have a distinct URL has that the host can give to other users. Other users can use this url to access the host's playlist.      It was also concious decsion to enhace user experience to not handle strict authentication for users to make it easy and effortless for users to join and create rooms.      TO start Q's server, first start mongodb server (mongod) and run npm start inside the project's main directory.      Q uses soundcloud's API.  In the current implementation, we had the client ID visible in the front end, but in later iterations, this searching should be moved to and hidden in the backend.      **Q uses ionic framework to enhance UI for mobile users: http://ionicframework.com/** "

1456,124,https://github.com/xuhuawei131/SimplifyReader,####新闻简读,-,xuhuawei131.SimplifyReader.md,4, * 介绍：API使用的是凤凰新闻客户端的接口，我只是简单的获取了新闻的列表和详情数据，由于api和凤凰新闻客户端完全一致，鉴于侵权问题我就不开源出来了。至于接口是如何获取的？Google，百度，调试获取日志，我能说的只有这么多。  * 功能：列表页使用自定义的ListView(自动加载更多）显示新闻列表，详情使用的是WebView加载，支持滑动返回。对于多图 新闻的处理，使用的和主流新闻客户端类似，滑动切换多张图片，可双指缩放图片大小！ 
1457,124,https://github.com/xuhuawei131/SimplifyReader,####图片浏览,-,xuhuawei131.SimplifyReader.md,4, * 介绍：API使用的是百度图片的搜索接口，由于网上有很多的开发者开源了这个接口，所以我也就放出来，如有侵权请及时告知。  * 功能：列表页使用的瀑布流效果（增加了下拉刷新和上拉加载更多）详情页和列表页的切换增加了一个图片放大或缩小到指定位置的效果，图片也可以双指缩放！ 
1458,124,https://github.com/xuhuawei131/SimplifyReader,####视频爽看,-,xuhuawei131.SimplifyReader.md,4, * 介绍：API使用的是优酷开放平台的SDK，不过要吐槽的一点是，优酷的SDK真心不好用，还是Eclipse版本的，我是一点点移植到Android Studio平台的，但是它的接口还是很丰富的，好好的利用一下，还是能够做出一个优秀的APP的。  * 功能：列表页使用了Google的CardView，简单的获取了一些视频的基本数据。播放页使用了优酷提供的视频播放器组件，传入视频ID就可以播放视频了，只要调通了SDK，其他的都是一些简单的数据获取！ 
1459,124,https://github.com/xuhuawei131/SimplifyReader,####音乐轻听,-,xuhuawei131.SimplifyReader.md,4, * 介绍：API获取的是豆瓣音乐的数据，由于也不是开放API，如有侵权请及时告知。  * 功能：播放音乐的界面是我自定义的一个唱机的View，很多思路都是从网上学习借鉴过来的，自己重新造了个轮子。UI和网易云音乐对比的话，只能说是形似神不似了，没有人家做的细致！ 
1460,124,https://github.com/xuhuawei131/SimplifyReader,####二维码扫描,-,xuhuawei131.SimplifyReader.md,4, * 介绍：这个完全是我自己单独开发的类库，之前也有开源出来，这次又再一次重构优化，后期会单独剥离二维码扫描模块，做成类库和Demo的形式，提供Android Studio版本。  * 功能：扫描界面使用xml进行布局，然后加入属性动画。这样布局更具有优势，更利于多屏幕适配。解码模块使用的是两个主流的开源库Zbar和ZXing，进过多次测试发现，ZBar虽然扫描效率和速度高于ZXing，但是经常扫描出错误的信息，可能由于太灵敏的缘故把，综合二者的优缺点还是建议使用ZXing来解码，并且这个项目还在长期维护更新！ 
1461,124,https://github.com/xuhuawei131/SimplifyReader,###致谢,-,xuhuawei131.SimplifyReader.md,3, * 苦于没有后台支持，找到这些支持JSON数据格式的开放接口可谓是煞费苦心，前前后后尝试了很多次才找到，也感谢网友们提供的接口！  * 界面的原型都是我自己构思的，后期的切图美化主要是Chris帮忙完成的，很感谢他业余时间和我一起完成这样一个APP！  * 项目中大量使用了Github上面优秀的开源项目，我会列举出来！其他一些代码片段就不一一致谢了，很感谢这些开放源码的技术大牛们，让我学到了很多！  * 最后如果觉得我的项目对你有所帮助，请点击我的支付宝付款码请我喝杯咖啡把~当然我也希望你们能够多多**fork**，多多**star**，多多**follow**，这将给我更多的动力开源更多的项目！

Small, atomic Features, bugs, etc. Use the `jb-development` branch but note it will likely change fast as pull requests are accepted. Please rebase as often as possible when working. Work on small, atomic features/bugs to avoid upstream commits affecting/breaking your development work.  For Big Features or major API extensions/edits: This is the one case where I'll accept pull-requests based off the master branch.

1501,128,https://github.com/zawieja/java8collections,## Streams,3,zawieja.java8collections.md,2,Stream (`java.util.Stream`) is a sequence of elements supporting operations. There are two kinds of stream operations: - intermediate (returns Stream) i.e.: `filter` - terminal  (returns other type) i.e.: `forEach`  Operations on stream don't modify source of stream. Stream operations form stream pipelines. 
1502,128,https://github.com/zawieja/java8collections,## Streams: filter,3,zawieja.java8collections.md,2,
1503,128,https://github.com/zawieja/java8collections,### Example,3,zawieja.java8collections.md,3,Writing down beers that have more than 5.0% alcohol in volume: ```java beers.stream()         .filter(b -> b.getAlcoholByValue() > 5.0)         .forEach(System.out::println); ```
1504,128,https://github.com/zawieja/java8collections,#### Explanation,3,zawieja.java8collections.md,4,`Predicate` is functional interface which is boolean-valued function of one argument. Operation `filter` takes instance of `Predicate` as argument and reduces stream to elements for which `Predicate` return `true`. In above example predicate is lambda `b -> b.getAlcoholByValue() > 5.0`. `filter` is intermediate operation (as it returns stream).

1509,128,https://github.com/zawieja/java8collections,#### Explanation,3,zawieja.java8collections.md,4,Operation `map` is intermediate operation (returns stream) which takes instance of `Function` as argument. It transforms (maps) each element of stream to another according to passed `Function`. `Function` is functonal interface.

It differs from problems of finding common substrings: unlike substrings, subsequences are not required to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences. The longest common subsequence problem is a classic computer science problem, and has applications in [bioinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics).  Use Python 2.7 (while entering the string, enter them in quotes :P)  This algorithm, printing the Longest Common Subsequence problem falls under Dynammic programming and has been implemented two compare two DNA strands and get the lenghthiest subsequence of all the genereated subsequences and print it's length. It also focuses on avoiding the overlapping i.e., avoid calculating the subsequence that has already been generated.

1614,135,https://github.com/randhika/LOST,## Usage,3,randhika.LOST.md,2," LOST is a drop-in replacement for Google Play Services [FusedLocationProviderApi][1] that makes calls directly to the [LocationManger][2].  This project seeks to provide an open source alternative to the [Fused Location Provider][3] that depends only on the Android SDK. Operations supported at this time include getting the last known location and registering for location updates.  **Connecting to the LOST API Client**  When using LOST, [`GoogleApiClient`](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/common/api/GoogleApiClient.html) is replaced by [`LostApiClient`](https://github.com/mapzen/LOST/blob/master/lost/src/main/java/com/mapzen/android/lost/api/LostApiClient.java). Connecting to LOST is even easier since there are no [`ConnectionCallbacks`](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/common/api/GoogleApiClient.ConnectionCallbacks.html) or [`OnConnectionFailedListener`](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/common/api/GoogleApiClient.OnConnectionFailedListener.html) objects to manage.  ```java LostApiClient lostApiClient = new LostApiClient.Builder(this).build(); lostApiClient.connect(); ```  LOST instantly connects to the [`LocationManager`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/LocationManager.html) and can immediately retrieve that last known location or begin sending location updates.  **Getting the Last Known Location**  Once connected you can request the last known location. The actual logic to determine the best most recent location is based this classic [blog post by Reto Meier](http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/06/deep-dive-into-location.html).   ```java Location location = LocationServices.FusedLocationApi.getLastLocation(); if (location != null) {   // Do stuff } ```  **Requesting Location Updates**  LOST also provides the ability to request ongoing location updates. You can specify the update interval, minimum displacement, and priority. The priority determines which location providers will be activated.  ```java LocationRequest request = LocationRequest.create()     .setInterval(5000)     .setSmallestDisplacement(10)     .setPriority(LocationRequest.PRIORITY_LOW_POWER);  LocationListener listener = new LocationListener() {   @Override   public void onLocationChanged(Location location) {     // Do stuff   } };  LocationServices.FusedLocationApi.requestLocationUpdates(request, listener); ```  Currently location updates can only be requested with a [`LocationListener`](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/location/LocationListener.html) object. In the future we are planning to add location updates via a [`PendingIntent`](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/PendingIntent.html) as well.  **Mock Locations**  With LOST you can mock not just individual locations but also entire routes. By loading a [GPX trace file](http://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp) onto the device you can configure LOST to replay locations from the trace file including latitude, longitude, speed, and bearing.  **Mocking a single location**  To mock a single location with LOST you must first enable mock mode. Then you simply create a mock location object and pass it to the API.  ```java Location mockLocation = new Location(""mock""); mockLocation.setLatitude(40.7484); mockLocation.setLongitude(-73.9857); LocationServices.FusedLocationApi.setMockMode(true); LocationServices.FusedLocationApi.setMockLocation(mockLocation); ```  The mock location object you set will be immediately returned to all registered listeners and will be returned the next time `getLastLocation()` is called.  **Mocking an entire route**  To mock an entire route you must first transfer a [GPX trace file](http://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp) to the device using [adb](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html). Sample GPX traces can be found on the [public GPS traces page](http://www.openstreetmap.org/traces) for OpenStreetMap. Once the trace file is loaded on the device you can tell LOST to replay the locations in the trace at the requested update interval.  ```java File file = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), ""mock_track.gpx""); LocationServices.FusedLocationApi.setMockMode(true); LocationServices.FusedLocationApi.setMockTrace(file); ```  For more in-depth examples, please refer to the [sample application](https://github.com/mapzen/LOST/tree/master/lost-sample).

Unfortunately, they can use too much memory. To compensate, we often use compressed bitmaps.  Roaring bitmaps are compressed bitmaps which tend to outperform conventional compressed bitmaps such as WAH, EWAH or Concise. In some instances, roaring bitmaps can be hundreds of times faster and they often offer significantly better compression. They can even be faster than uncompressed bitmaps.  This library is used by Apache Spark (https://spark.apache.org/) and Druid.io (http://druid.io/). Apache Lucene (http://lucene.apache.org/) uses  Roaring bitmaps, though they have their own [independent implementation](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/lucene/dev/branches/branch_5x/lucene/core/src/java/org/apache/lucene/util/RoaringDocIdSet.java?view=markup&pathrev=1629606).

The following code sample illustrates how to create an ImmutableRoaringBitmap from a ByteBuffer. In such instances, the constructor only loads the meta-data in RAM while the actual data is accessed from the ByteBuffer on demand.          import org.roaringbitmap.buffer.*;          //...          MutableRoaringBitmap rr1 = MutableRoaringBitmap.bitmapOf(1, 2, 3, 1000);         MutableRoaringBitmap rr2 = MutableRoaringBitmap.bitmapOf( 2, 3, 1010);         ByteArrayOutputStream bos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();         DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(bos);         rr1.serialize(dos);         rr2.serialize(dos);         dos.close();         ByteBuffer bb = ByteBuffer.wrap(bos.toByteArray());         ImmutableRoaringBitmap rrback1 = new ImmutableRoaringBitmap(bb);         bb.position(bb.position() + rrback1.serializedSizeInBytes());         ImmutableRoaringBitmap rrback2 = new ImmutableRoaringBitmap(bb);  Operations on an ImmutableRoaringBitmap such as and, or, xor, flip, will generate a RoaringBitmap which lies in RAM. As the name suggest, the ImmutableRoaringBitmap itself cannot be modified.  This design was inspired by druid.io.  One can find a complete working example in the test file TestMemoryMapping.java.  Note that you should not mix the classes from the org.roaringbitmap package with the classes from the org.roaringbitmap.buffer package. They are incompatible. They serialize to the same output however. "

1690,143,https://github.com/manekinekko/gaia,### Unit Tests,3,manekinekko.gaia.md,3," Unit tests for an app go in `apps/<APP>/test/unit/`.  To run all the unit tests with B2G Desktop:  1. Run `DEBUG=1 make` 2. Run `make test-agent-server &` 3. Run B2G Desktop and open the Test Agent app 4. Run `make test-agent-test`     or `make test-agent-test APP=<APP>` to run unit tests for a    specific app  More importantly, you can use test-agent-server to watch the files on the filesystem and execute relevant tests when they change:  1. Run `DEBUG=1 make` 2. Run `make test-agent-server &` 3. Run B2G Desktop and open the Test Agent app 4. Edit files and when you save them, glance at the console with    test-agent-server running  Note: If you add new files, you will need to restart test-agent-server.  As a convenience, you can also use the `gaia-test` script to launch the test-agent-server and open the Test Agent app in firefox:  1. Add firefox to your `$PATH` or set `$FIREFOX` to your preferred    firefox/aurora/nightly binary. 2. Run `./bin/gaia-test` to run the test-agent-server and launch firefox. 3. Run `make test-agent-test` or modify files as described above.  For more details on writing tests, see: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Mozilla/Boot_to_Gecko/Gaia_Unit_Tests "
1691,143,https://github.com/manekinekko/gaia,### Integration Tests,3,manekinekko.gaia.md,3, Gaia uses [marionette-js-runner](https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/marionette-js-runner) to run the tests with a custom builder for gaia. Tests should live with the rest of your apps code (in apps/my_app/test/marionette) and test files should end in _test.js.  All integration tests run under a node environment. You need node >= 0.10 for this to work predictably.  Shared code for tests lives under shared/test/integration. 
1692,143,https://github.com/manekinekko/gaia,#### Running integration tests,3,manekinekko.gaia.md,4, NOTE: unless your tests end in _test.js they will not be automatically picked up by `make test-integration`.  ```sh make test-integration ``` 
1693,143,https://github.com/manekinekko/gaia,#### Invoking a test file,3,manekinekko.gaia.md,4," ```sh make test-integration TEST_FILES=<test> ```  For example, we could run the `day_view_test.js` test in calendar app with the below command. ``` make test-integration TEST_FILES=apps/calendar/test/marionette/day_view_test.js ```  If you would like to run more than one test, we could do the below command. ``` make test-integration TEST_FILES=""apps/calendar/test/marionette/day_view_test.js apps/calendar/test/marionette/today_test.js"" ``` "
1694,143,https://github.com/manekinekko/gaia,#### Invoking tests for a specific app,3,manekinekko.gaia.md,4," ```sh make test-integration APP=<APP> ```  For example, we could run all tests for the calendar app with `make test-integration APP=calendar`. "
1695,143,https://github.com/manekinekko/gaia,#### Skipping a test file,3,manekinekko.gaia.md,4,"```sh make test-integration SKIP_TEST_FILES=<test> ``` For example, we could skip the `day_view_test.js` test in calendar app with the below command. ``` make test-integration SKIP_TEST_FILES=apps/calendar/test/marionette/day_view_test.js ```  If you would like to skip more than one test, we could do the below command. ``` make test-integration SKIP_TEST_FILES=""apps/calendar/test/marionette/day_view_test.js apps/calendar/test/marionette/today_test.js"" ```  Notice that we could not use the `TEST_FILES` and `SKIP_TEST_FILES` parameters at the same time. "
1696,143,https://github.com/manekinekko/gaia,#### Running tests while working,3,manekinekko.gaia.md,4," If you wish to run many tests in background you might not want to be disturbed by the b2g-desktop window popping everytime, or the sound. One solution for the first issue is to use Xvfb:  ```sh xvfb-run make test-integration ```  If you are using PulseAudio and want to keep the tests quied, then just force an invalid server:  ```sh PULSE_SERVER="":"" make test-integration ```  You can of course combine both:  ```sh PULSE_SERVER="":"" xvfb-run make test-integration ``` "
1697,143,https://github.com/manekinekko/gaia,#### Running tests without building profile,3,manekinekko.gaia.md,4," if you would like to run tests without building profile, use `make test-integration-test`: ```sh PROFILE_FOLDER=profile-test make # generate profile directory in first time make test-integration-test ``` "

1701,143,https://github.com/manekinekko/gaia,#### Gotchas,3,manekinekko.gaia.md,4," - For performance reasons we don't run `make profile` for each test   run this means you need to manually remove the `profile-test`   folder when you make changes to your apps.  - If you don't have a b2g folder one will be downloaded for you.   This can be problematic if you're offline. You can symlink a   b2g-desktop directory to b2g/ in gaia to avoid the download.  - If you have some weird node errors, try removing node_modules since   things may be stale.  - To get debug information from the b2g desktop client, run this: `DEBUG=b2g-desktop TEST_FILES=name/of/test.js ./bin/gaia-marionette`  - To get debug information from b2g desktop and all of the marionette plugins, run this: `DEBUG=* TEST_FILES=name/of/test.js ./bin/gaia-marionette` "

1710,144,https://github.com/Koulio/jison,## An API for creating parsers in JavaScript,1,Koulio.jison.md,2,"-----------------------------------------  Jison generates bottom-up parsers in JavaScript. Its API is similar to Bison's, hence the name. It supports many of Bison's major features, plus some of its own. If you are new to parser generators such as Bison, and Context-free Grammars in general, a [good introduction][1] is found in the Bison manual. If you already know Bison, Jison should be easy to pickup.  Briefly, Jison takes a JSON encoded grammar or Bison style grammar and outputs a JavaScript file capable of parsing the language described by that grammar. You can then use the generated script to parse inputs and accept, reject, or perform actions based on the input. "

Therefore, it's recommended to run this script with authentication by using a **token**.  Here's how:  - [Generate a token here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?description=GitHub%20Changelog%20Generator%20token) - you only need ""repo"" scope for private repositories - Either:     - Run the script with `--token <your-40-digit-token>`; **OR**     - Set the `CHANGELOG_GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to your 40 digit token  You can set an environment variable by running the following command at the prompt, or by adding it to your shell profile (e.g., `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc`):          export CHANGELOG_GITHUB_TOKEN=""«your-40-digit-github-token»""  So, if you got an error like this: >! /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/github_api-0.12.2/lib/github_api/response/raise_error.rb:14:in `on_complete'  It's time to create this token!

And since you're naming the `rake` task yourself, you can create as many as you want.  You can look for params names from the [parser source code (#setup_parser)](https://github.com/skywinder/github-changelog-generator/blob/master/lib/github_changelog_generator/parser.rb). For example, to translate the bugs label to Portuguese, instead of setting `config.bugs_label`, you have to set `config.bug_prefix`, and so on. "

Why do I need this?***  GitHub Releases is a very good thing. And it's very good practice to maintain it. (Not a lot of people are using it yet!) :congratulations:  *BTW: I would like to support GitHub Releases in [next releases](https://github.com/skywinder/github-changelog-generator/issues/56) ;)*  I'm not trying to compare the quality of handwritten and auto-generated logs. That said....  An auto-generated changelog really helps, even if you manually fill in the release notes!  For example:  When I found a closed bug, it's very useful know which release fixed it. In this case, you can easily find the issue by \# in `CHANGELOG.md`.  - it's not quite as easy to find this in handwritten releases notes - a generated file saves you the trouble of remembering everything;   sometimes people forget to add things to a handwritten file  Ultimately, I think GitHub Releases is ideal for end-users. Meanwhile, `CHANGELOG.md` lives right in the repository, with its detailed list of changes, which is handy for developers. Finally, there's nothing wrong with using GitHub Releases alongside `CHANGELOG.md` in this combination.  - ***I received a warning: ""GitHub API rate limit exceed""  What does this mean?***  GitHub [limits the number of API requests](https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting) you can make in an hour. You can make up to 5,000 requests per hour. For unauthenticated requests, the rate limit is only up to 60 requests per hour. Unauthenticated requests are associated with your IP address (not the user making requests).  If you're seeing this warning, please do the following:  1. Make sure you're providing an OAuth token, so you're not making requests anonymously. Using an OAuth token increases your hourly request maximum from 60 to 5000. 2. If you have a large repo with lots of issues/PRs, you can use `--max-issues NUM` to limit the number of issues that are pulled back. For example: `--max-issues 1000`  - ***My Ruby version is very old, can I use this?***  When your Ruby is old, and you don't want to upgrade, and you want to control which libraries you use, you can use Bundler.  In a Gemfile, perhaps in a non-deployed `:development` group, add this gem:  ```ruby group :development do   gem 'github_changelog_generator', require: false end ```  Then you can keep back dependencies like rack, which currently is only compatible with Ruby >= 2.2.2. So, use an older version for your app by adding a line like this to the Gemfile:  ``` gem 'rack', '~> 1.6' ```  This way, you can keep on using github_changelog_generator, even if you can't get the latest version of Ruby installed.

1744,147,https://github.com/vpothuri/phpiredis,## Installation ##,3,vpothuri.phpiredis.md,2," Building and using this extension requires `hiredis` (>=0.9.0 <1.0.0) to be installed on the system. `hiredis` is usually available in the repositories of most Linux distributions, alternatively it is possible to build it by fetching the code from its [repository](https://github.com/redis/hiredis).  ```sh git clone https://github.com/nrk/phpiredis.git cd phpiredis phpize && ./configure --enable-phpiredis make && make install ```  When the configuration script is unable to locate `hiredis` on your system, you can specify in which directory it can be found using `--with-hiredis-dir=` (e.g. `--with-hiredis-dir=/usr/local`).  Phpiredis provides a basic test suite that can be launched with `make test`. Tests require a running instance of `redis-server` listening on `127.0.0.1:6379` but __make sure__ that your server does not hold data you are interested: you could end up losing everything stored on it!  If you notice a failing test or a bug, you can contribute by opening a pull request on GitHub or simply file a bug on our [issue tracker](http://github.com/nrk/phpiredis/issues). "
1745,147,https://github.com/vpothuri/phpiredis,## Usage ##,3,vpothuri.phpiredis.md,2," Connecting to Redis is as simple as calling the `phpiredis_connect()` function with a server address as the first parameter and an optional port number when the server is listening to a different port than the default `6379`:  ```php $redis = phpiredis_connect('127.0.0.1', 6379);      // normal connection $redis = phpiredis_pconnect('127.0.0.1', 6379);     // persistent connection ```  Alternatively you can connect to redis using UNIX domain socket connections.  ```php $redis = phpiredis_connect('/tmp/redis.sock');      // normal connection $redis = phpiredis_pconnect('/tmp/redis.sock');     // persistent connection ```  Once the connection is established, you can send commands to Redis using `phpiredis_command_bs()` or pipeline them using `phpiredis_multi_command_bs()`:  ```php $response = phpiredis_command_bs($redis, array('DEL', 'test'));  $response = phpiredis_multi_command_bs($redis, array(     array('SET', 'test', '1'),     array('GET', 'test'), )); ```  The `_bs` suffix indicates that these functions can handle binary key names or values by using the unified Redis protocol available since Redis >= 1.2.  Commands can still be sent using the old and deprecated inline protocol using `phpiredis_command()` and `phpiredis_multi_command()` (note the lack of the `_bs` suffix) but it's highly discouraged and these functions will be removed in future versions of phpiredis.  ```php $response = phpiredis_command($redis, 'DEL test');  $response = phpiredis_multi_command($redis, array(     'SET test 1',     'GET test', )); ``` "

More?* How much of that do you really use?  Sure, we all love our favorite monolithic frameworks, and sometimes we even use them fully. But how often do we reach for the ride-on John Deere tractor with air conditioning and six-speaker sound system, when a judiciously applied pocketknife would do the trick better, faster, slicker?  Micro-frameworks are definitely the pocketknives of the JavaScript library world: short, sweet, to the point. And at 5k and under, micro-frameworks are very very portable. A micro-framework does one thing and one thing only — and does it well. No cruft, no featuritis, no feature creep, no excess anywhere.  Microjs.com helps you discover the most compact-but-powerful microframeworks, and makes it easy for you to pick one that’ll work for you. "

1790,152,https://github.com/nigredo-tori/patty,# Patty - A pattern matching library,13,nigredo-tori.patty.md,1,"==================================  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andreaferretti/patty.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/andreaferretti/patty) [![nimble](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yglukhov/nimble-tag/master/nimble_js.png)](https://github.com/yglukhov/nimble-tag)  Patty is a library to perform pattern matching in Nim. The patterns have to be [variant objects](http://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#types-object-variants), which in Nim are encoded with a field (usually called `kind`) which varies in an enum, and a different object layout based on the value of this tag. An example would be  ```nim type   ShapeKind = enum     Circle, Rectangle   Shape = object     case kind: ShapeKind     of Circle:       r: float     of Rectangle:       w, h: float ```  If you have such an algebraic data type, you can do the following with Patty:  ```nim import patty  proc makeRect(w, h: float): Shape = Shape(kind: Rectangle, w: w, h: h)  match makeRect(3, 4):   Circle(r: radius):     echo ""it is a circle of radius "", radius   Rectangle(w: width, h: height):     echo ""it is a rectangle of height "", height ```  This will be translated by the `match` macro into the following form  ```nim let :tmp = makeRect(3, 4) case :tmp.kind of Circle:   let radius = :tmp.r   echo ""it is a circle of radius "", radius of Rectangle:   let     width = :tmp.w     height = :tmp.h   echo ""it is a rectangle of height "", height ```  Matching by position is also valid, like this:  ```nim match makeRect(3, 4):   Circle(radius):     echo ""it is a circle of radius "", radius   Rectangle(width, height):     echo ""it is a rectangle of height "", height ```  One can also use `_` for a variable, in which case it will not be bound. That is, the following  ```nim import patty  proc makeRect(w, h: float): Shape = Shape(kind: Rectangle, w: w, h: h)  match makeRect(3, 4):   Circle(r: radius):     echo ""it is a circle of radius "", radius   Rectangle(w: _, h: height):     echo ""it is a rectangle of height "", height ```  becomes  ```nim let :tmp = makeRect(3, 4) case :tmp.kind of Circle:   let radius = :tmp.r   echo ""it is a circle of radius "", radius of Rectangle:   let height = :tmp.h   echo ""it is a rectangle of height "", height ```  Notice that in the examples, the field you dispatch on is called `kind`, but any other name would do. Also, checks are exhaustive: if you miss a case, the compiler will complain.  One can instead pattern-match on non-variant objects, which essentially amounts to deconstructing fields:  ```nim type Person = object   name: string   age: int let p = Person(name: ""John Doe"", age: 37) match p:   Person(name: n, age: a):     echo n, ""is "", a, "" years old"" ```  Again, this is the same as  ```nim match p:   Person(n, a):     echo n, ""is "", a, "" years old"" ``` "
1791,152,https://github.com/nigredo-tori/patty,## Constructing variant objects,3,nigredo-tori.patty.md,2,"----------------------------  Patty also provides another macro to create algebraic data types. It looks like  ```nim variant Shape:   Circle(r: float)   Rectangle(w: float, h: float)   UnitCircle ```  and expands to  ```nim type   ShapeKind {.pure.} = enum     Circle, Rectangle, UnitCircle   Shape = object     case kind: ShapeKind     of ShapeKind.Circle:       r: float     of ShapeKind.Rectangle:       w: float       h: float     of ShapeKind.UnitCircle:       nil  proc `==`(a: Shape; b: Shape): bool =   if a.kind == b.kind:     case a.kind     of ShapeKind.Circle:       return a.r == b.r     of ShapeKind.Rectangle:       return a.w == b.w and a.h == b.h     of ShapeKind.UnitCircle:       return true   else:     return false  proc Circle(r: float; x: float; y: float): Shape =   Shape(kind: ShapeKind.Circle, r: r)  proc Rectangle(w: float; h: float): Shape =   Shape(kind: ShapeKind.Rectangle, w: w, h: h)  proc UnitCircle(side: int): Shape =   Shape(kind: ShapeKind.UnitCircle) ```  Notice that the macro also generates three convenient constructors (`Circle` ,`Rectangle` and `UnitCircle`), and in fact the enum is pure to avoid a name conflict. Also, a proper definition of equality based on the actual contents of the record is generated.  **By default the generated ADT is private to the module**. If you want to generate a public ADT use the `variantp` macro, which has the same syntax as `variant` but makes the types, fields, equality definition and generated constructors public.  A couple of limitations fo the `variant` macro:  * field names must be unique across branches (that is, different variants cannot have two fields with the same name). This is actually a limitation of Nim. * the shortcut that groups field names by type does not seem to work, that is, in the above example one could not write `Rectangle(w, h: float)`.  In the future, Patty may also add copy constructors. Also, some work needs to be done to make it easier to use the generated contructors with `ref` types, in particular for the important case of recursive algebraic data types. "
1792,152,https://github.com/nigredo-tori/patty,## Versions,4,nigredo-tori.patty.md,2,"--------  Patty 0.1.8 works for latest Nim (devel). For older versions of Nim (up to 0.13.0), use Patty 0.1.7. "
1793,152,https://github.com/nigredo-tori/patty,## Things that do not work (yet),3,nigredo-tori.patty.md,2,"-----------------------------  One would expect many forms of pattern matching but, at least for now, the support in Patty is very limited. Things that would be nice to support but do not work yet include:  * matching a constant  ```nim match c:   ""hello"":     echo ""the string was hello"" ```  * matching an existing variable  ```nim let x = 5 match c:   x:     echo ""c == 5"" ```  * nested pattern matching  ```nim match c:   Circle(Point(x: x, y: y), r: r):     echo ""the abscissa of the center is "", x ```  * matching without binding  ```nim match c:   Circle:     echo ""it is a circle!"" ```  * binding subpatterns  ```nim match getMeACircle():   c@Circle(x, y, r):     echo ""there you have "", c ```  * pattern matching as an expression should be simply  ```nim let coord = match c:   Circle(x: x, y: y, r: r):     x   Rectangle(w: w, h: h):     h ```  Right now it works (with latest nim devel) like this:  ```nim let coord = (block:   match c:     Circle(x: x, y: y, r: r):       x     Rectangle(w: w, h: h):       h ) ```  * unification  ```nim match r:   Rectangle(w: x, h: x):     echo ""it is a square"" ```  * guards  ```nim match c:   Circle(x: x, y: y, r: r) if r < 0:     echo ""the circle has negative length"" ```  * variable-length pattern matching, such as with arrays  ```nim match c:   [a, b, c]:     echo ""the length is 3 and the first elements is "", a ```  * custom pattern matchers, such as in regexes  ```nim let Email = r""(\w+)@(\w+).(\w+)"" match c:   Email(name, domain, tld):     echo ""hello "", name ```  * combining patterns with `or`  ```nim match c:   Circle or Rectangle:     echo ""it is a shape"" ```"

1805,153,https://github.com/QuickQi1/ews-cpp,### Linux,3,QuickQi1.ews-cpp.md,3, The library is header-only. So there is no need to build anything. Just copy the `include/ews/` directory wherever you may like.  To build the accompanied tests with debugging symbols and Address Sanitizer enabled do something like this:  ```bash cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DENABLE_ASAN=ON /path/to/source make ```  Type `make edit_cache` to see all configuration options. `make help` shows you all available targets. 
1806,153,https://github.com/QuickQi1/ews-cpp,### Windows,3,QuickQi1.ews-cpp.md,3," To build the tests and examples on Windows you can use `cmake-gui`.  For more see: https://cmake.org/runningcmake/  If you do not want to use any GUI to compile the examples and tests you could do something like this with the Windows `cmd.exe` command prompt:  ```bat set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files (x86)\CMake\bin mkdir builddir cd builddir cmake -G ""Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64"" ^     -DCURL_LIBRARY=""C:\Program Files\cURL\7.49.1\win64-debug\lib\libcurl_debug.lib"" ^     -DCURL_INCLUDE_DIR=""C:\Program Files\cURL\7.49.1\win64-debug\include"" ^     C:\path\to\source cmake --build . ```  Make sure to choose the right generator for your environment.

Do not run the tests on your own production account.  Once you've build the project, you can execute the tests with:  ```bash ./tests --assets=/path/to/source/tests/assets ```  "
1809,153,https://github.com/QuickQi1/ews-cpp,## Design Notes,6,QuickQi1.ews-cpp.md,2," ews-cpp is written in a ""modern C++"" way:  * C++ Standard Library, augmented with rapidxml for XML parsing * Smart pointers instead of raw pointers * Pervasive RAII idiom * Handle errors using C++ exceptions * Coding conventions inspired by Boost  "
1810,153,https://github.com/QuickQi1/ews-cpp,## API,6,QuickQi1.ews-cpp.md,2, Just add:  ```c++
1811,153,https://github.com/QuickQi1/ews-cpp,#include <ews/ews.hpp>,8,QuickQi1.ews-cpp.md,1,"```  to your include directives and you are good to go.  Take a look at the `examples/` directory to get an idea of how the API feels. ews-cpp is a thin wrapper around Microsoft's EWS API. You will need to refer to the [EWS reference for Exchange](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/bb204119%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx) for all available parameters to pass and all available attributes on items. From 10.000ft it looks like this:   <img src=""ews-objects.png"" width=80%>   You have items and you have **the** service. You use the service whenever you want to talk to the Exchange server.  Please note one important caveat though. ews-cpp's API is designed to be ""blocking"". This means whenever you call one of the service's member functions to talk to an Exchange server that call blocks until it receives a request from the server. And that may, well, just take forever (actually until a timeout is reached). You need to keep this in mind in order to not block your main or UI thread.  Implications of this design choice  Pros:  * A blocking API is much easier to use and understand  Cons:  * You just might accidentally block your UI thread * You cannot issue thousands of EWS requests asynchronously simply because you   cannot spawn thousands of threads in your process. You may need additional   effort here "

Although most features of the underlying Bloomberg API are available, some options might not be reachable through the jBloomberg API.  You can browse the [javadoc](http://assylias.github.com/jBloomberg/apidocs/index.html) for more information, including example usages. "

Then run:      mvn install:install-file -Dfile=c:/temp/blpapi-3.8.7-2.jar -DgroupId=com.bloombergblp -DartifactId=blpapi -Dversion=3.8.7.2 -Dpackaging=jar "
1841,156,https://github.com/NunoEdgarGub1/jBloomberg,###Description,2,NunoEdgarGub1.jBloomberg.md,3," The main advantages of this library vs. the Bloomberg API are:  - Less string based configuration: whenever possible enums are used to remove the typos issues - Less verbose: retrieving historical data literally takes 5 lines of code, whereas when using the Bloomberg API, the code gets quickly cluttered with parsing, error handling and so on - Fluent design: most queries to Bloomberg are prepared with builders using the fluent interface pattern - The library takes thread safety seriously (so does the Bloomberg API): all actions / objects are thread safe and can be used in a multi threaded application (unless indicated otherwise, for example the builders) - Uses the standard java.util.concurrent package objects, so the syntax / way of doing things should look familiar to Java developers. For example, a historical data request returns a `Future<HistoricalData>`  It should however be noted that using jBloomberg does increase memory consumption and GC vs. using BLPAPI directly although for most applications that should not be noticeable.

Glide includes a flexible API that allows developers to plug in to almost any network stack. By default Glide uses a custom `HttpUrlConnection` based stack, but also includes utility libraries plug in to Google's Volley project or Square's OkHttp library instead.  Glide's primary focus is on making scrolling any kind of a list of images as smooth and fast as possible, but Glide is also effective for almost any case where you need to fetch, resize, and display a remote image.

1868,158,https://github.com/IbpTeam/sqlite3,# INSTALLING,3,IbpTeam.sqlite3.md,1," You can use [`npm`](https://github.com/isaacs/npm) to download and install:  * The latest `sqlite3` package: `npm install sqlite3`  * GitHub's `master` branch: `npm install https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3/tarball/master`  In both cases the module is automatically built with npm's internal version of `node-gyp`, and thus your system must meet [node-gyp's requirements](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp#installation).  It is also possible to make your own build of `sqlite3` from its source instead of its npm package ([see below](#building-from-the-source)).  It is possible to use the installed package in [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) instead of the vanilla Node.js, but a rebuild is required before use (see the next section).  "
1869,158,https://github.com/IbpTeam/sqlite3,# REBUILDING FOR NODE-WEBKIT,36,IbpTeam.sqlite3.md,1," Because of ABI differences, only a rebuilt version of `sqlite3` can be used in [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit).  After the `sqlite3` module is installed (according to the previous section), do the following:  1. Install [`nw-gyp`](https://github.com/rogerwang/nw-gyp) globally: `npm install nw-gyp -g` *(unless already installed)*  2. Use `nw-gyp` to rebuild the module:  ``` NODE_WEBKIT_VERSION=""0.8.4"" # see latest version at https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit#downloads nw-gyp rebuild --target=${NODE_WEBKIT_VERSION} ```  Remember the following:  * In the `nw-gyp rebuild` command, specify the actual target version of your node-webkit. The command must be run in sqlite3's directory (where its `package.json` resides).  * After the `sqlite3` package is rebuilt for node-webkit it cannot run in the vanilla Node.js (and vice versa).    * For example, `npm test` of the node-webkit's package would fail.    * If you need `sqlite3` package both for Node.js and node-webkit, then you should make two separate installations of `sqlite3` (in different directories) and rebuild only one of them for node-webkit.  Visit the “[Using Node modules](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit/wiki/Using-Node-modules)” article in the node-webkit's wiki for more details.  "
1870,158,https://github.com/IbpTeam/sqlite3,# BUILDING FROM THE SOURCE,3,IbpTeam.sqlite3.md,1," Unless building via `npm install` (which uses its own `node-gyp`) you will need `node-gyp` installed globally:      npm install node-gyp -g  The sqlite3 module depends only on libsqlite3. However, by default, an internal/bundled copy of sqlite will be built and statically linked, so an externally installed sqlite3 is not required.  If you wish to install against an external sqlite then you need to pass the `--sqlite` argument to `node-gyp`, `npm install` or the `configure` wrapper.      ./configure --sqlite=/usr/local     make  Or, using the node-gyp directly:       node-gyp --sqlite=/usr/local      make  Or, using npm:       npm install --sqlite=/usr/local  If building against an external sqlite3 make sure to have the development headers available. Mac OS X ships with these by default. If you don't have them installed, install the `-dev` package with your package manager, e.g. `apt-get install libsqlite3-dev` for Debian/Ubuntu. Make sure that you have at least `libsqlite3` >= 3.6.  Note, if building against homebrew-installed sqlite on OS X you can do:      ./configure --sqlite=/usr/local/opt/sqlite/     make  "

To run these files from a location on your computer make sure to have the appropriate version of Python installed:  1.  Navigate to the correct folder  2.  Run the python module 'entertainment_center.py'.  3.  This should open a new tab in the default browser with the newly created page fresh_tomatoes.html.  "

1897,162,https://github.com/haisonle/passwordless,### 1. Install the module:,3,haisonle.passwordless.md,3," `$ npm install passwordless --save`  You'll also want to install a [TokenStore](https://passwordless.net/plugins) such as [MongoStore](https://github.com/florianheinemann/passwordless-mongostore) and something to deliver the tokens (be it email, SMS or any other means). For example:  `$ npm install passwordless-mongostore --save`  `$ npm install emailjs --save`  If you need to store your tokens differently consider [developing a new TokenStore](https://github.com/florianheinemann/passwordless-tokenstore-test) and [let us know](https://twitter.com/thesumofall). "
1898,162,https://github.com/haisonle/passwordless,### 2. Require the needed modules,3,haisonle.passwordless.md,3,You will need: * Passwordless * A TokenStore to store the tokens such as [MongoStore](https://github.com/florianheinemann/passwordless-mongostore) * Something to deliver the tokens such as [emailjs](https://github.com/eleith/emailjs) for email or [twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/node/install) for text messages / SMS  ```javascript var passwordless = require('passwordless'); var MongoStore = require('passwordless-mongostore'); var email   = require('emailjs'); ``` 
1899,162,https://github.com/haisonle/passwordless,### 3.

1901,162,https://github.com/haisonle/passwordless,### 5. Tell Passwordless how to deliver a token,3,haisonle.passwordless.md,3,"`passwordless.addDelivery(deliver)` adds a new delivery mechanism. `deliver` is called whenever a token has to be sent. By default, the mechanism you choose should provide the user with a link in the following format:  `http://www.example.com/token={TOKEN}&uid={UID}`  That's how you could do this with emailjs: ```javascript // Set up a delivery service passwordless.addDelivery( 	function(tokenToSend, uidToSend, recipient, callback) { 		var host = 'localhost:3000'; 		smtpServer.send({ 			text:    'Hello!\nAccess your account here: http://' 			+ host + '?token=' + tokenToSend + '&uid=' 			+ encodeURIComponent(uidToSend), 			from:    yourEmail, 			to:      recipient, 			subject: 'Token for ' + host 		}, function(err, message) { 			if(err) { 				console.log(err); 			} 			callback(err); 		}); }); ``` "
1902,162,https://github.com/haisonle/passwordless,### 6. Setup the middleware for express,3,haisonle.passwordless.md,3,"```javascript app.use(passwordless.sessionSupport()); app.use(passwordless.acceptToken({ successRedirect: '/'})); ```  `sessionSupport()` makes the login persistent, so the user will stay logged in while browsing your site. Make sure to have added your session middleware *before* this line. Have a look at [express-session](https://github.com/expressjs/session) how to setup sessions if you are unsure. Please be aware: If you decide to use [cookie-session](https://github.com/expressjs/cookie-session) rather than e.g. express-session as your middleware you have to set `passwordless.init(tokenStore, {skipForceSessionSave:true})`  `acceptToken()` will accept incoming tokens and authenticate the user (see the URL in step 5). While the option `successRedirect` is not strictly needed, it is strongly recommended to use it to avoid leaking valid tokens via the referrer header of outgoing HTTP links. When provided, the user will be forwarded to the given URL as soon as she has been authenticated.  Instead of accepting tokens on any URL as done above you can also restrict the acceptance of tokens to certain URLs: ```javascript // Accept tokens only on /logged_in (be sure to change the // URL you deliver in step 5) router.get('/logged_in', passwordless.acceptToken(), 	function(req, res) { 		res.render('homepage'); }); ``` "

The router,3,haisonle.passwordless.md,3,"The following takes for granted that you've already setup your router `var router = express.Router();` as explained in the [express docs](http://expressjs.com/4x/api.html#router)  You will need at least URLs to: * Display a page asking for the user's email (or phone number, ...) * Receive these details (via POST) and identify the user  For example like this: ```javascript /* GET login screen. */ router.get('/login', function(req, res) {    res.render('login'); });  /* POST login details. */ router.post('/sendtoken', 	passwordless.requestToken( 		// Turn the email address into an user's ID 		function(user, delivery, callback, req) { 			// usually you would want something like: 			User.find({email: user}, callback(ret) { 			   if(ret) 			      callback(null, ret.id) 			   else 			      callback(null, null) 	      }) 	      // but you could also do the following 	      // if you want to allow anyone: 	      // callback(null, user); 		}), 	function(req, res) { 	   // success!   		res.render('sent'); }); ```  What happens here? `passwordless.requestToken(getUserId)` has two tasks: Making sure the email address exists *and* transforming it into a proper user ID that will become the identifier from now on. For example user@example.com becomes 123 or 'u1002'. You call `callback(null, ID)` if all is good, `callback(null, null)` if you don't know this email address, and `callback('error', null)` if something went wrong. At this stage, please make sure that you've added middleware to parse POST data (such as [body-parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser)).  Most likely, you want a user registration page where you take an email address and any other user details and generate an ID. However, you can also simply accept any email address by skipping the lookup and just calling `callback(null, user)`.  In an even simpler scenario and if you just have a fixed list of users do the following: ```javascript // GET login as above  var users = [ 	{ id: 1, email: 'marc@example.com' }, 	{ id: 2, email: 'alice@example.com' } ];  /* POST login details. */ router.post('/sendtoken', 	passwordless.requestToken( 		function(user, delivery, callback) { 			for (var i = users.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) { 				if(users[i].email === user.toLowerCase()) { 					return callback(null, users[i].id); 				} 			} 			callback(null, null); 		}), 		function(req, res) { 			// success! 		res.render('sent'); }); ``` "
1904,162,https://github.com/haisonle/passwordless,### 8. Login page,3,haisonle.passwordless.md,3,"All you need is a form where users enter their email address, for example: ```html <html> 	<body> 		<h1>Login</h1> 		<form action=""/sendtoken"" method=""POST""> 			Email: 			<br><input name=""user"" type=""text""> 			<br><input type=""submit"" value=""Login""> 		</form> 	</body> </html> ``` By default, Passwordless will look for a field called `user` submitted via POST. "
1905,162,https://github.com/haisonle/passwordless,### 9. Protect your pages,3,haisonle.passwordless.md,3,"You can protect all pages that should only be accessed by authenticated users by using the `passwordless.restricted()` middleware, for example: ```javascript /* GET restricted site. */ router.get('/restricted', passwordless.restricted(),  function(req, res) {   // render the secret page }); ``` You can also protect a full path, by adding: ```javascript router.use('/admin', passwordless.restricted()); ``` "
1906,162,https://github.com/haisonle/passwordless,### 10. Who is logged in?,3,haisonle.passwordless.md,3,"Passwordless stores the user ID in req.user (this can be changed via configuration). So, if you want to display the user's details or use them for further requests, do something like: ```javascript router.get('/admin', passwordless.restricted(), 	function(req, res) { 		res.render('admin', { user: req.user }); }); ``` You could also create a middleware that is adding the user to any request and enriching it with all user details. Make sure, though, that you are adding this middleware after `acceptToken()` and `sessionSupport()`: ```javascript app.use(function(req, res, next) { 	if(req.user) { 		User.findById(req.user, function(error, user) { 			res.locals.user = user; 			next(); 		}); 	} else { 		next(); 	} }) ``` "

1908,162,https://github.com/haisonle/passwordless,### Logout,3,haisonle.passwordless.md,3,"Just call `passwordless.logout()` as in: ```javascript router.get('/logout', passwordless.logout(), 	function(req, res) { 		res.redirect('/'); }); ``` "
1909,162,https://github.com/haisonle/passwordless,### Redirects,3,haisonle.passwordless.md,3,"Redirect non-authorised users who try to access protected resources with `failureRedirect` (default is a 401 error page): ```javascript router.get('/restricted', 	passwordless.restricted({ failureRedirect: '/login' }); ```  Redirect unsuccessful login attempts with `failureRedirect` (default is a 401 or 400 error page): ```javascript router.post('/login', 	passwordless.requestToken(function(user, delivery, callback) { 		// identify user }, { failureRedirect: '/login' }), 	function(req, res){ 		// success }); ```  After the successful authentication through `acceptToken()`, you can redirect the user to a specific URL with `successRedirect`: ```javascript app.use(passwordless.acceptToken( 	{ successRedirect: '/' })); ``` While the option `successRedirect` is not strictly needed, it is strongly recommended to use it to avoid leaking valid tokens via the referrer header of outgoing HTTP links on your site. When provided, the user will be forwarded to the given URL as soon as she has been authenticated. If not provided, Passwordless will simply call the next middleware. "
1910,162,https://github.com/haisonle/passwordless,### Error flashes,3,haisonle.passwordless.md,3,"Error flashes are session-based error messages that are pushed to the user with the next request. For example, you might want to show a certain message when the user authentication was not successful or when a user was redirected after accessing a resource she should not have access to. To make this work, you need to have sessions enabled and a flash middleware such as [connect-flash](https://www.npmjs.org/package/connect-flash) installed.  Error flashes are supported in any middleware of Passwordless that supports `failureRedirect` (see above) but only(!) if `failureRedirect` is also supplied: - `restricted()` when the user is not authorized to access the resource - `requestToken()` when the supplied user details are unknown  As an example: ```javascript router.post('/login', 	passwordless.requestToken(function(user, delivery, callback) { 		// identify user }, { failureRedirect: '/login', failureFlash: 'This user is unknown!' }), 	function(req, res){ 		// success }); ```  The error flashes are pushed onto the `passwordless` array of your flash middleware. Check out the [connect-flash docs](https://github.com/jaredhanson/connect-flash) how to pull the error messages, but a typical scenario should look like this:  ```javascript router.get('/mistake', 	function(req, res) { 		var errors = req.flash('passwordless'), errHtml; 		for (var i = errors.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) { 			errHtml += '<p>' + errors[i] + '</p>'; 		} 		res.send(200, errHtml); }); ``` "
1911,162,https://github.com/haisonle/passwordless,### Success flashes,3,haisonle.passwordless.md,3,"Similar to error flashes success flashes are session-based messages that are pushed to the user with the next request. For example, you might want to show a certain message when the user has clicked on the token URL and the token was accepted by the system. To make this work, you need to have sessions enabled and a flash middleware such as [connect-flash](https://www.npmjs.org/package/connect-flash) installed.  Success flashes are supported by the following middleware of Passwordless: - `acceptToken()` when the token was successfully validated - `logout()` when the user was logged in and was successfully logged out - `requestToken()` when the token was successfully stored and send out to the user  Consider the following example: ```javascript router.get('/logout', passwordless.logout( 	{successFlash: 'Hope to see you soon!'} ), 	function(req, res) {   	res.redirect('/home'); }); ```  The messages are pushed onto the `passwordless-success` array of your flash middleware. Check out the [connect-flash docs](https://github.com/jaredhanson/connect-flash) how to pull the messages, but a typical scenario should look like this:  ```javascript router.get('/home', 	function(req, res) { 		var successes = req.flash('passwordless-success'), html; 		for (var i = successes.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) { 			html += '<p>' + successes[i] + '</p>'; 		} 		res.send(200, html); }); ``` "
1912,162,https://github.com/haisonle/passwordless,### 2-step authentication (e.g. for SMS),3,haisonle.passwordless.md,3,"For some token-delivery channels you want to have the shortest possible token (e.g. for text messages). One way to do so is to remove the user ID from the token URL and to only keep the token for itself. The user ID is then kept in the session. In practice his could look like this: A user types in his phone number, hits submit, is redirected to another page where she has to type in the token received per SMS, and then hit submit another time.  To achieve this, requestToken stores the requested UID in `req.passwordless.uidToAuth`. Putting it all together, take the following steps:  **1: Read out `req.passwordless.uidToAuth`**  ```javascript // Display a new form after the user has submitted the phone number router.post('/sendtoken', passwordless.requestToken(function(...) { }, 	function(req, res) {   	res.render('secondstep', { uid: req.passwordless.uidToAuth }); }); ```  **2: Display another form to submit the token submitting the UID in a hidden input**  ```html <html> 	<body> 		<h1>Login</h1> 		<p>You should have received a token via SMS. Type it in below:</p> 		<form action=""/auth"" method=""POST""> 			Token: 			<br><input name=""token"" type=""text""> 			<input type=""hidden"" name=""uid"" value=""<%= uid %>""> 			<br><input type=""submit"" value=""Login""> 		</form> 	</body> </html> ```  **3: Allow POST to accept tokens**  ```javascript router.post('/auth', passwordless.acceptToken({ allowPost: true }), 	function(req, res) { 		// success! }); ``` "
1913,162,https://github.com/haisonle/passwordless,### Successful login and redirect to origin,3,haisonle.passwordless.md,3,"Passwordless supports the redirect of users to the login page, remembering the original URL, and then redirecting them again to the originally requested page as soon as the token has been accepted. Due to the many steps involved, several modifications have to be undertaken:  **1: Set `originField` and `failureRedirect` for passwordless.restricted()**  Doing this will call `/login` with `/login?origin=/admin` to allow later reuse ```javascript router.get('/admin', passwordless.restricted( 	{ originField: 'origin', failureRedirect: '/login' })); ```  **2: Display `origin` as hidden field on the login page**  Be sure to pass `origin` to the page renderer. ```html <form action=""/sendtoken"" method=""POST""> 	Token: 	<br><input name=""token"" type=""text""> 	<input type=""hidden"" name=""origin"" value=""<%= origin %>""> 	<br><input type=""submit"" value=""Login""> </form> ```  **3: Let `requestToken()` accept `origin`**  This will store the original URL next to the token in the TokenStore. ```javascript app.post('/sendtoken', passwordless.requestToken(function(...) { }, 	{ originField: 'origin' }), 	function(req, res){ 		// successfully sent }); ```  **4: Reconfigure `acceptToken()` middleware**  ```javascript app.use(passwordless.acceptToken( { enableOriginRedirect: true } )); ``` "
1914,162,https://github.com/haisonle/passwordless,### Several delivery strategies,3,haisonle.passwordless.md,3,"In case you want to use several ways to send out tokens you have to add several delivery strategies to Passwordless as shown below: ```javascript passwordless.addDelivery('email', 	function(tokenToSend, uidToSend, recipient, callback) { 		// send the token to recipient }); passwordless.addDelivery('sms', 	function(tokenToSend, uidToSend, recipient, callback) { 		// send the token to recipient }); ``` To simplify your code, provide the field `delivery` to your HTML page which submits the recipient details. Afterwards, `requestToken()` will allow you to distinguish between the different methods: ```javascript router.post('/sendtoken', 	passwordless.requestToken( 		function(user, delivery, callback) { 			if(delivery === 'sms') 				// lookup phone number 			else if(delivery === 'email') 				// lookup email 		}), 	function(req, res) {   		res.render('sent'); }); ``` "
1915,162,https://github.com/haisonle/passwordless,### Modify lifetime of a token,3,haisonle.passwordless.md,3,"This is particularly useful if you use shorter tokens than the default to keep security on a high level: ```javascript // Lifetime in ms for the specific delivery strategy passwordless.addDelivery( 	function(tokenToSend, uidToSend, recipient, callback) { 		// send the token to recipient }, { ttl: 1000*60*10 }); ``` "
1916,162,https://github.com/haisonle/passwordless,### Allow token reuse,3,haisonle.passwordless.md,3,"By default, all tokens are invalidated after they have been used by the user. Should a user try to use the same token again and is not yet logged in, she will not be authenticated. In some cases (e.g. stateless operation or increased convenience) you might want to allow the reuse of tokens. Please be aware that this might open up your users to the risk of valid tokens being used by third parties without the user being aware of it.  To enable the reuse of tokens call `init()` with the option `allowTokenReuse: true`, as shown here: ```javascript passwordless.init(new TokenStore(), 	{ allowTokenReuse: true }); ``` "
1917,162,https://github.com/haisonle/passwordless,### Different tokens,3,haisonle.passwordless.md,3,"You can generate your own tokens. This is not recommended except you face delivery constraints such as SMS-based authentication. If you reduce the complexity of the token, please consider reducing as well the lifetime of the token (see above): ```javascript passwordless.addDelivery( 	function(tokenToSend, uidToSend, recipient, callback) { 		// send the token to recipient }, {tokenAlgorithm: function() {return 'random'}}); ``` "
1918,162,https://github.com/haisonle/passwordless,### Stateless operation,3,haisonle.passwordless.md,3,"Just remove the `app.use(passwordless.sessionSupport());` middleware. Every request for a restricted resource has then to be combined with a token and uid. You should consider the following points: * By default, tokens are invalidated after their first use. For stateless operations you should call `passwordless.init()` with the following option: `passwordless.init(tokenStore, {allowTokenReuse:true})` (for details see above) * Tokens have a limited lifetime. Consider extending it (for details see above), but be aware about the involved security risks * Consider switching off redirects such as `successRedirect` on the `acceptToken()` middleware "
1919,162,https://github.com/haisonle/passwordless,## The tokens and security,3,haisonle.passwordless.md,2,"By default, tokens are generated using 16 Bytes of pseudo-random data as produced by the cryptographically strong crypto library of Node.js. This can be considered strong enough to withstand brute force attacks especially when combined with a finite time-to-live (set by default to 1h). In addition, it is absolutely mandatory to store the tokens securely by hashing and salting them (done by default with TokenStores such as [MongoStore](https://github.com/florianheinemann/passwordless-mongostore)). Security can be further enhanced by limiting the number of tries per user ID before locking that user out from the service for a certain amount of time. "

1974,167,https://github.com/serenabi/workflow-plugin,# Introduction,12,serenabi.workflow-plugin.md,1," Building continuous delivery pipelines and similarly complex tasks in Jenkins using freestyle projects and existing plugins is very awkward. You need to mix Parameterized Trigger, Copy Artifact, Promoted Builds, Conditional Build Step, and more just to express what should be a simple script. This project attempts to make it possible to directly write that script, what people often call a _workflow_ (sometimes abbreviated _flow_), while integrating with Jenkins features like slaves and publishers. "
1975,167,https://github.com/serenabi/workflow-plugin,# Core features,1,serenabi.workflow-plugin.md,1, Specific status of implementation below. 
1976,167,https://github.com/serenabi/workflow-plugin,## Scripted control flow,1,serenabi.workflow-plugin.md,2," Your whole workflow is a single Groovy script using an embedded DSL, possibly quite short and legible; there is no need to jump between multiple job configuration screens to see what is going on. Conditions, loops, variables, parallel tasks, and so on are defined using regular language constructs. At any point you can insert a shell script to do “real work” (compilation, etc.). "
1977,167,https://github.com/serenabi/workflow-plugin,## Jenkins model object integration,16,serenabi.workflow-plugin.md,2," Standard DSL functions let you run external processes, grab slave nodes, allocate workspaces, build “legacy” (freestyle) jobs, and so on.  See [here](basic-steps/CORE-STEPS.md) for information on reusing build steps from freestyle projects. "
1978,167,https://github.com/serenabi/workflow-plugin,## Pause and resume execution,1,serenabi.workflow-plugin.md,2," If Jenkins is restarted (intentionally, or because of a crash) while your workflow is running, when it comes back up, execution is resumed where it left off. This applies to external processes (shell scripts) so long as the slave can be reattached, and losing the slave connection temporarily is not fatal either.  Flows can pause in the middle and wait for a human to approve something, or enter some information. Executors are not consumed while the flow is waiting. "
1979,167,https://github.com/serenabi/workflow-plugin,## SCM integration,6,serenabi.workflow-plugin.md,2, See [here](scm-step/README.md) for details on using version control from a workflow. 
1980,167,https://github.com/serenabi/workflow-plugin,## Pipeline stages,1,serenabi.workflow-plugin.md,2," Workflows can be divided into sequential stages, not only for labeling but to throttle concurrency. "
1981,167,https://github.com/serenabi/workflow-plugin,# Getting started,6,serenabi.workflow-plugin.md,1, Read the [tutorial](TUTORIAL.md) to get started writing workflows. 
1982,167,https://github.com/serenabi/workflow-plugin,# Installation,3,serenabi.workflow-plugin.md,1," If you do not want to build from sources, releases (see the [changelog](CHANGES.md) for details on which) are available on the Jenkins update center. You need to be running a sufficiently recent Jenkins release, currently an LTS in the 1.580.x line, or a newer weekly release.  For OSS Jenkins users, install _Workflow: Aggregator_ (its dependencies will be pulled in automatically). You will need to restart Jenkins to complete installation.  Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees users get Workflow automatically as of the 14.11 release. Otherwise install _CloudBees Workflow: Aggregator_ from the update center. Again dependencies will be pulled in automatically, including all the OSS plugins. "
1983,167,https://github.com/serenabi/workflow-plugin,# Demo,3,serenabi.workflow-plugin.md,1," See the [demo overview](demo/README.md) using Docker if you want to try a complete setup quickly.  If you want to try running recent development changes, rather than released binaries, you have two options. You can run directly from the source tree; from the root of the repository:      mvn -DskipTests clean install && mvn -f aggregator hpi:run  Then visit http://localhost:8080/jenkins/ to play with the plugins.  (If your IDE supports compile-on-save mode this is especially convenient since each `hpi:run` will pick up compiled changes from member plugins without needing to run to `package` phase.)  You can also run the Docker demo with snapshot binaries:      make -C demo run-snapshot  The snapshot Docker demo is mainly useful for verifying the effect of ongoing changes on future demo binary releases. You get the `cd` sample job set up, but your environment is thrown away if you kill the Docker container (for example with Ctrl-C). When using `hpi:run` the same `aggregator/work/` home directory is reused so long as you do not explicitly delete it. "

There is [more documentation there](basic-steps/CORE-STEPS.md). * `api` defines the essential aspects of flows and their executions. In particular, the engine running a flow is extensible and so could in the future support visual orchestration languages. * `support` adds general implementations of some internals needed by flows, such as storing state. * `job` provides the actual job type and top-level UI for defining and running flows. * `durable-task-step` uses the `durable-task` plugin to define a shell script step that can survive restarts. * `scm-step` adds SCM-related steps. There is [more documentation there](scm-step/README.md). * `cps` is the flow engine implementation based on the Groovy language, and supporting long-running flows using a _continuation passing style_ transformation of the script. * `cps-global-lib` adds a Git-backed repository for Groovy libraries available to scripts. * `stm` is a simple engine implementation using a _state transition machine_, less intended for end users than as a reference for how engines can work. Currently only partly implemented. * `aggregator` is a placeholder plugin allowing you to `mvn hpi:run` and see everything working together, as well as holding integration tests."

[Purchasing the ebook directly from O'Reilly](http://bit.ly/135dHfs) offers a number of great benefits, including a variety of digital formats and continual updates to the text of book for life! Better yet, if you choose to use O'Reilly's DropBox or Google Drive synchronization, your ebooks will automatically update every time there's an update. In other words, you'll always have the latest version of the book if you purchase the ebook through O'Reilly, which is why it's the recommended option in comparison to a paper copy or other electronic version. (If you prefer a [paperback or Kindle version from Amazon](http://amzn.to/GPd59m), that's a fine option as well.)  There's an incredible turn-key virtual machine experience for this second edition of the book that provides you with a powerful social web mining toolbox. This toolbox provides the ability to explore and run all of the source code in a hassle-free manner. All that you have to do is [follow a few simple steps](https://rawgithub.com/ptwobrussell/Mining-the-Social-Web-2nd-Edition/master/ipynb/html/_Appendix A - Virtual Machine Experience.html) to get the virtual machine installed, and you'll be running the example code in as little as 20-30 minutes. (And by the way, most of that time is waiting for files to download.)  This [short screencast](https://vimeo.com/72383764) demonstrates the steps involved in installing the virtual machine, which installs every single dependency for you automatically and save you a lot of time. Even sophisticated power users tend to prefer using it versus using their own environments.  If you experience any problems at all with installation of the virtual machine, file an issue here on GitHub. Be sure to also follow [@SocialWebMining](http://twitter.com/socialwebmining) on Twitter and like http://facebook.com/MiningTheSocialWeb on Facebook.

Unfortunately, some of the Python dependencies for the example code can be a little bit tricky to get installed and configured, so providing a completely turn-key virtual machine to make your reading experience as simple and enjoyable as possible is in order. Even if you are a seasoned developer, you may still find some value in using this virtual machine to get started and save yourself some time. The virtual machine is powered with [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/), an amazing development tool that you'll probably want to know about and arguably makes working with virtualization even easier than a native [Virtualbox](http://www.virtualbox.org/) or VMWare image.

2047,176,https://github.com/mucyomiller/xact,## `xact` is a recipe for handling transactions sensibly in Django applications on PostgreSQL.,123,mucyomiller.xact.md,2," **Note**: As of Django 1.6, the functionality of `xact` will be merged into the Django core as the [`atomic` decorator](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/transactions/#django.db.transaction.atomic). Code that uses `xact` should be able to be migrated to `atomic` with just a search-and-replace. `atomic` works on databases other than PostgreSQL, is thread-safe, and has other nice features; switch to it when you can!  The goals are:  * Database operations that do not modify the database aren't wrapped in a transactions at all. * Database operations that modify the database are wrapped in a transactions. * We have a lot of fine-grained control over sections that modify the databse vs those that don't.  The bits of the recipe are:  * Use the [autocommit option](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/databases/#autocommit-mode) in your database configuration. * *Do not* use the [transaction middleware](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/transactions/#tying-transactions-to-http-requests). * Wrap the sections of code which modify the database in the `xact()` decorator / context manager below, using it like you would the [`commit_on_success()`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/transactions/#controlling-transaction-management-in-views) decorator. * Profit!  The quick reasons behind each step:  * Turning on autocommit prevents [psycopg2](http://initd.org/psycopg/) from automatically starting a new transaction on the first database operation on each connection; this means that the transaction only starts when we want it to. * Similarly, the transaction middleware will set the connection state to ""managed,"" which will defeat the autocommit option above, so we leave it out. * The `xact()` decorator will set up the connection so that a transaction *is* started in the relevant block, which is what we want for database-modifying operations.  This recipe a few other nice features:  * `xact()` operates like `commit_on_success()`, in that it will issue a rollback if an exception escapes from the block or function it is wrapping. * `xact()` ignores the dirty flag on the Django connection. Since we're deliberately wrapping stuff that modifies the database with it, the chance of it being dirty is near 100%, and a commit on a transaction that did not modify the database is no more expensive in PostgreSQL than a rollback. It also means you can do [raw SQL](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/sql/) inside an `xact()` block without the [foot-gun](http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-hackers/2008-06/msg01101.php) of forgetting to call `set_dirty`. * Like the built-in Django transaction decorators, it can be used either as a decorator or as a context manager with the `with` statement. * `xact()` can be nested, giving us nested transactions! If it sees that there is already a transaction open when it starts a new block, it will use a [savepoint](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/sql-savepoint.html) to set up a nested transaction block.  (PostgreSQL does not have nested transactions as such, but you can use savepoints to get 99.9% of the way there.) * By not wrapping operations that do not modify the database, we get better behavior when using [pgPool II](http://www.pgpool.net/) (more on that in a future post). * `xact()` works around an [outstanding bug](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/16047) in Django's transaction handling on psycopg2.  `xact()` also supports the `using` parameter for [multiple databases](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/multi-db/).  `Rollback` is a supplied exception class designed for situations in which you want to trigger an exception to cause a rollback, but do not want that exception to propagate beyond the scope of the `xact` block.  `xact` will perform the rollback, then swallow the exception.  Of course, a few caveats:  * `xact()` requires the `postgresql_psycopg2` backend, and PostgreSQL 8.2 or higher. It's possible it can be hacked to work on other backends that support savepoints. * `xact()` works just the way you want if it is nested *inside* a `commit_on_success()` block (it will properly create a savepoint insted of a new transaction). However, a `commit_on_success()` block nested inside of `xact()` will commit or rollback the entire transaction, somewhat defeating the outer `xact()`. To the extent possible, use only `xact()` in code you write. * Be sure you catch exceptions *outside of* the `xact()` block; otherwise, the automatic rollback will be defeated. Allow the exception to escape the `xact()` block, and then catch it. (Of course, if the intention is to always commit and to defeat the rollback, by all means catch the exception inside the block.)  To use, just drop the source (one class definition, one function) into a file somewhere in your Django project (such as the omni-present `utils` application every Django project seems to have), and include it.  Examples:      from utils.transaction import xact      @xact     def my_view_function1(request):        # Everything here will be in a transaction.        # It'll roll back if an exception escapes, commits otherwise.      def my_view_function2(request):        # This stuff won't be in a transaction, so don't modify the database here.        with xact():           # This stuff will be, and will commit on normal completion, roll back on a exception      def my_view_function3(request):        with xact():           # Modify the database here (let's call it ""part 1"").           try:              with xact():                 # Let's call this ""part 2.""                 # This stuff will be in its own savepoint, and can commit or                 # roll back without losing the whole transaction.           except:              # Part 2 will be rolled back, but part 1 will still be available to              # be committed or rolled back.  Of course, if an exception              # inside the ""part 2"" block is not caught, both part 2 and              # part 1 will be rolled back. "

These type of devices are part of the ""quantified self"" movement -- a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. But these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to obtain and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for processing and interpreting the data.  This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day.

Commit your `PA1_template.md` and `PA1_template.html` files produced by processing your R markdown file with the `knit2html()` function in R (from the **knitr** package)  3. If your document has figures included (it should) then they should have been placed in the `figure/` directory by default (unless you overrode the default). Add and commit the `figure/` directory to your git repository.  4. Push your `master` branch to GitHub.  5. Submit the URL to your GitHub repository for this assignment on the course web site.  In addition to submitting the URL for your GitHub repository, you will need to submit the 40 character SHA-1 hash (as string of numbers from 0-9 and letters from a-f) that identifies the repository commit that contains the version of the files you want to submit. You can do this in GitHub by doing the following:  1. Go into your GitHub repository web page for this assignment  2. Click on the ""?? commits"" link where ?? is the number of commits you have in the repository. For example, if you made a total of 10 commits to this repository, the link should say ""10 commits"".  3. You will see a list of commits that you have made to this repository. The most recent commit is at the very top. If this represents the version of the files you want to submit, then just click the ""copy to clipboard"" button on the right hand side that should appear when you hover over the SHA-1 hash. Paste this SHA-1 hash into the course web site when you submit your assignment. If you don't want to use the most recent commit, then go down and find the commit you want and copy the SHA-1 hash.  A valid submission will look something like (this is just an **example**!)  ```r https://github.com/rdpeng/RepData_PeerAssessment1  7c376cc5447f11537f8740af8e07d6facc3d9645 ```"

Think of it this way. When you're driving a car, you can only go through a light **if** the light is green. **Otherwise**, if the light is yellow, you prepare to slow down; and if the light is red, you stop. Notice that we have distinct cases that we want to check for.  In programming, when we check for a statement in this way, we check to see whether the statement is `true` or `false`. JavaScript, being the friendly language that it is, uses `true` and `false` directly to mean exactly what they say. "
2079,181,https://github.com/jwolfe890/skills-based-javascript-intro-to-flow-control-v-000,## Comparisons,3,jwolfe890.skills-based-javascript-intro-to-flow-control-v-000.md,2," The example above might be written, in pseudo-JavaScript (for once, this won't work in the browser console), like this:  ``` javascript if (lightIsGreen) {   go() } else if (lightIsRed) {   stop() } else if (lightIsYellow) {   slowDown() } ```  When we get down to it, every `if` statement like the above is saying, ""If the thing in the parentheses is `true`, then do what's between the curly braces.""  But before we dive in to `if` statements, how do the things in parentheses _become_ `true` or `false`?  JavaScript lets us compare things. Most of these comparisons come straight from math: we can ask if something is less than something else (enter these in your console!):  ``` javascript 3 < 5 // true 3 < 2 // false 3 < 3 // false 3 < 10000000 // true 'alpha' < 'beta' // true (!) ```  We can ask if something is greater than something else:  ``` javascript 5 > -1 // true 5 > 5 // false 20 > 30 // false 'gamma' > 'beta' // true (!) ```  We can even ask if something is less-than-or-equal-to something else:  ``` javascript 20 <= 30 // true 20 <= 20 // true 20 <= 10 // false ```  or greater-than-or-equal-to something:  ``` javascript 5 >= 5 // true 5 >= 1 // true 5 >= 10 // false ```  How do we test if something is _exactly_ equal to something else? We know that we can't just use `=`, because that's how we assign values to variables. Instead, we need to use `===`:  ``` javascript 5 === 5 // true 4 === 5 // false '5' === 5 // false parseInt('5', 10) === 5 // true ```  **Top Tip**: Sometimes you'll see only `==` for comparison in JavaScript. It's best to use `===`, as the former will try to _coerce_ values in order to compare them, meaning that it's not always comparing what it _says_ it's comparing! "
2080,181,https://github.com/jwolfe890/skills-based-javascript-intro-to-flow-control-v-000,## Combining Comparisons,3,jwolfe890.skills-based-javascript-intro-to-flow-control-v-000.md,2," We can string together these comparisons using `&&` (pronounced ""and"") and `||` (""or""):  ``` javascript 5 === 5 && 10 < 11 // true 5 === 6 && 10 < 11 // false 5 === 5 && 10 < 9 // false  4 > 5 || 20 <= 20 // true 4 > 5 || 20 < 19 // false 4 > 3 || 20 < 19 // true ```  With `&&`, _both_ statements (to the left and right of `&&`) must be `true` in order for the entire _expression_ (that is, the entire _phrase_) to be `true`; with `||`, only one of the statements needs to be `true`.  Keep in mind that JavaScript reads these combinations from left to right, returns the last statement it saw, and only evaluates as many statements as necessary. So if we write,  ``` javascript 5 === 5 && 1 ```  JavaScript won't return `true`, it will return `1`. If instead we write,  ``` javascript 5 === 4 && 0 ```  JavaScript will return `false`, because it stops evaluating the `&&` expression (again, this just means the entire phrase of comparisons) on its first false encounter. Similarly, if we write,  ``` javascript 200 < 100 || 'alphabet' ```  JavaScript will return 'alphabet', because it needs to evaluate the right-hand side of `||` (since `200 < 100` is `false`). But if we write,  ``` javascript 200 > 100 || 'treasure' ```  JavaScript simply returns `true` — it doesn't even check the right-hand side of `||`. "

You'll be writing your code in `flow-control.js`. Make sure to run the tests using `learn`. "
2082,181,https://github.com/jwolfe890/skills-based-javascript-intro-to-flow-control-v-000,### `if` Statements,3,jwolfe890.skills-based-javascript-intro-to-flow-control-v-000.md,3," `if` statements look like this:  ``` javascript if (something) {   // do something } ```  They work as the name implies: _if_ `something` is _truthy_ (so the boolean `true` or anything other than the empty string (`''`), `0`, `null`, or `undefined`), the code in between the curly braces runs; if not, the code between the curly braces is skipped.  Now, in `flow-control.js` let's write a function called `basicTeenager` that accepts an age as a parameter. The function should contain an if-statement that checks to see if the age is a teenager. If the age is between 13 and 19, return `""You are a teenager!""` "
2083,181,https://github.com/jwolfe890/skills-based-javascript-intro-to-flow-control-v-000,### `if`-`else` Statements,3,jwolfe890.skills-based-javascript-intro-to-flow-control-v-000.md,3," You will often see an `if` statement used in combination with an  `else` clause. An `else` clause will only get executed if the previous `if` statement is falsey.  Syntax:  ```javascript if (conditionToTest) {   // executed if `conditionToTest` is truthy } else {   // executed if `conditionToTest` is falsey } ```  + Define a function `teenager` that accepts an age as a parameter. If the age is between 13 and 19 it should return `""You are a teenager!""`. Otherwise, the function should return `""You are not a teenager""`. "
2084,181,https://github.com/jwolfe890/skills-based-javascript-intro-to-flow-control-v-000,### `if`/`else if` Statements,3,jwolfe890.skills-based-javascript-intro-to-flow-control-v-000.md,3," `if` statements can also be combined with an `else if` clause. This is like an `else` statement, but with its own condition. It will only run if its condition is true, and the previous statement's condition was false.  ```javascript if (conditionToTest1) {     // condition is false hence code is not executed } else if (conditionToTest2) {   // execute this code if `conditionToTest1`statement is falsey AND `conditionToTest2` is truthy } ```  You can optionally add a final `else` statement after all of your `else if` statements. You can probably guess what will happen: if _all of the other statements_ are falsey, this final `else` block will execute; otherwise, an earlier statement executes and the `else` block is skipped.  ``` javascript if (conditionToTest1) {   // condition is false hence code is not executed } else if (conditionToTest2) {   // execute this code if `conditionToTest1` statement is falsey AND `conditionToTest2` is truthy } else {   // execute this code iff none of the other conditions are met } ```  + Define a function `ageChecker` that takes in an age as a parameter. If the age is between 13-19 it should return `""You are a teenager!""`. If the age is 12 or below, it should return `""You are a kid""`. If the age is above 19, it should return `""You are a grownup""`  **Top tip**: Remember, if you place a `return` statement before the end of the function, anything after `return` **won't get executed**. We can use this to make code terser:  ```javascript function canGo(lightColor) {   if (lightColor === 'green') {     return true   }    return false } ```  The above function will return `true` if `lightColor` is `'green'` — go ahead and try it out.  ```javascript canGo('green') // true ```  And `false` otherwise:  ```javascript canGo('red') // false ```  Notice that we didn't have to use an `else` statement; we can just depend on `return`.  We need to be careful with `return`, however, because it's easy to return too early and not execute important parts of the function. For example,  ```javascript function canGo(lightColor) {   return true    if (lightColor === 'red') {     return false   } } ```  will _always_ return `true`, even if `lightColor` is `'red'`. Try it!  ```javascript canGo('red') // true ```  And that's a great way to cause an accident. "
2085,181,https://github.com/jwolfe890/skills-based-javascript-intro-to-flow-control-v-000,### Ternary Operator,3,jwolfe890.skills-based-javascript-intro-to-flow-control-v-000.md,3," You can think of it as a shortcut for the `if-else` statement.  This operator tests a condition; if the condition is truthy, it evaluates the left-hand side of the colon; otherwise it evaluates the right-hand side of the colon.  Syntax:  ```javascript conditionToTest ? valueToBeReturnedIfTrue : valueToBeReturnedIfFalse ```  + Define a function `ternaryTeenager` that accepts age as a parameter. The body of the function should use the ternary operator to return `""You are a teenager""` if age is between 13-19 and returns `""You are not a teenager""` if the age is anything else.  **Top tip**: In order for the function to actually **return** the evaluation of the ternary operator, you'll need to prepend `return` to the expression:  ```javascript return conditionToTest ? valueToBeReturnedIfTrue : valueToBeReturnedIfFalse ``` "
2086,181,https://github.com/jwolfe890/skills-based-javascript-intro-to-flow-control-v-000,## Switch Statements,3,jwolfe890.skills-based-javascript-intro-to-flow-control-v-000.md,2," Switch statements acts like a big if/else if/else chain. The switch expression is evaluated once and the value of the expression is compared with the values of each case. If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.  Syntax:  ```javascript switch (expression) {   case n:       // code to be executed if case n is true       break; // break out of switch statement once code executed   case m:       // code to be executed if case m is true       break; // break out of switch statement once code executed   default:  // all other cases       // code to be executed if case n and case m false } ```  Example:  ```javascript var mood = ""hungry"" switch(mood) {   case ""happy"":     console.log(""Dance to Pharrell's 'Happy'"");     break;   case ""sad"":     console.log(""You should eat a pint of ice cream"");     break;   case ""anxious"":     console.log(""Take some deep breaths"");     break;   case ""hungry"":     console.log(""You should eat a big chocolate cake"");     break;   default:     console.log(""That's not a mood we support""); } ```  In the example above, we'll see `""You should eat a big chocolate cake""` printed to the console. If we change the value of the `mood` variable to `sad` you'll see `""You should eat a pint of ice cream""`. If the value of `mood` changed to `""grumpy""`, the default statement would trigger and print out `""That's not a mood we support""`.  + Define a function `switchAge` that accepts an age as a parameter. The case statement should switch on `age` and return `""You are a teenager""` if the age is 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, or 19, and return `""You have an age""` as the default.  As with any function, `return` will halt execution at any point. Thus if we wrote,  ```javascript function feelings(mood) {   switch(mood) {     case ""happy"":       return ""Dance to Pharrell's 'Happy'""     default:       return ""I don't recognize that mood.""   }    console.log(""Let us know how you're feeling tomorrow!"") } ```  the `console.log()` statement at the bottom of the function will _never run_. This is a major difference between `return` and `break`: `return` _exits_ the function and _returns_ a value; `break` exits a _block_ and does not (generally speaking) have a value associated with it.

2091,183,https://github.com/Kryndex/microservices-examples,# Building and running the microservices,3,Kryndex.microservices-examples.md,1,A simple example of microservices that is described in this [series of blog posts](http://plainoldobjects.com/2014/11/16/deploying-spring-boot-based-microservices-with-docker/).  There are two services: * RESTful service - exposes a REST API for registering a user. It saves the user registration in MongoDB and posts a message to RabbitMQ. It is the example code for the article [Building microservices with Spring Boot - part 1](http://plainoldobjects.com/2014/04/01/building-microservices-with-spring-boot-part1/).  * Web application - implements the user registration UI and invokes the RESTful service. It is the example code for the article [Building microservices with Spring Boot - part 2](https://plainoldobjects.com/2014/05/05/building-microservices-with-spring-boot-part-2/).  The services are written in Scala and use the following technologies.  * Spring Boot * Spring Cloud * Netflix OSS Eureka * RabbitMQ  Note: There are [other example microservice applications](http://eventuate.io/exampleapps.html).   This project uses with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to run the services as well as RabbitMQ and MongoDB.  The `spring-boot-webapp` project uses Selenium to test the web UI using the Chrome browser. You will need to install [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/getting-started). On Mac OSX you can run `brew install chromedriver`.  
2092,183,https://github.com/Kryndex/microservices-examples,## The quick way,3,Kryndex.microservices-examples.md,2," The quickest way to build and run the services on Linux/Mac OSX is with the following commands:  ``` . ./set-env.sh ./gradle-all.sh assemble docker-compose up -d ./show-urls.sh ```  Otherwise, follow these instructions. "
2093,183,https://github.com/Kryndex/microservices-examples,## Running MongoDB and RabbitMQ,3,Kryndex.microservices-examples.md,2, The RESTful service uses RabbitMQ and MongoDB. The easier way to run them is to using Docker:  ```  docker-compose up -d mongodb rabbitmq ```  You also need to set some environment variables so that the services can connect to them:  ``` export DOCKER_HOST_IP=$(docker-machine ip default 2>/dev/null)  export SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI=mongodb://${DOCKER_HOST_IP}/userregistration export SPRING_RABBITMQ_HOST=${DOCKER_HOST_IP} ``` 
2094,183,https://github.com/Kryndex/microservices-examples,## Build the Eureka server,3,Kryndex.microservices-examples.md,2, This application uses Netflix OSS Eureka for service discovery. Build the Spring Cloud based Eureka server using the following commands:  ``` cd eureka-server ./gradlew build ``` 
2095,183,https://github.com/Kryndex/microservices-examples,## Build the Zipkin server,3,Kryndex.microservices-examples.md,2, This application uses Zipkin for distributed tracing. Build the Zipkin server using the following commands:  ``` cd zipkin-server ./gradlew build ``` 
2096,183,https://github.com/Kryndex/microservices-examples,## Building the RESTful service,3,Kryndex.microservices-examples.md,2, Use the following commands to build the RESTful service:  ```  cd spring-boot-restful-service  ./gradlew build  ```   ## Running the RESTful service   You can run the service by using the following command in the top-level directory:   ```  docker-compose up -d restfulservice  ``` 
2097,183,https://github.com/Kryndex/microservices-examples,## Using the RESTful service,3,Kryndex.microservices-examples.md,2," Once the service has started, you can send a registration request using:  ``` ./register-user.sh ```  You can examine the MongoDB database using the following commands  ``` $ ./mongodb-cli.sh > show dbs; local             0.031GB mydb              0.031GB userregistration  0.031GB > use userregistration; switched to db userregistration > > > show collections; registeredUser system.indexes > > > db.registeredUser.find() { ""_id"" : ObjectId(""55a99b0993860551c6020e9d""), ""_class"" : ""net.chrisrichardson.microservices.restfulspringboot.backend.RegisteredUser"", ""emailAddress"" : ""1437178632863-b-foo@bar.com"", ""password"" : ""secret"" } > exit $ ``` "
2098,183,https://github.com/Kryndex/microservices-examples,## Building the web application,3,Kryndex.microservices-examples.md,2," Since the web application invokes the RESTful service you must set the following environment variable:  ``` export USER_REGISTRATION_URL=http://${DOCKER_HOST_IP}:8081/user ```  Next, use the following commands to build the web application:   ``` cd spring-boot-webapp ./gradlew build ``` "
2099,183,https://github.com/Kryndex/microservices-examples,## Running the web application,3,Kryndex.microservices-examples.md,2, Run the web application using the following command in the top-level directory:  ``` docker-compose up -d web ``` 
2100,183,https://github.com/Kryndex/microservices-examples,## Using the web application,3,Kryndex.microservices-examples.md,2, You can access the web application by visiting the following URL: `http://${DOCKER_HOST_IP?}:8080/register.html`  There are also other URLs that you can visit. The following command will wait until the services are available and displays the URLs:  ``` ./show-urls.sh ``` 
2101,183,https://github.com/Kryndex/microservices-examples,# Building and running Docker images,3,Kryndex.microservices-examples.md,1, The previous instructions deployed the services as Docker containers without actually packaging the services as Docker images. The `docker-compose.yml` file ran the image `java:openjdk-8u91-jdk` and used volume mapping to make the Spring Boot jar files accessible. Follow these instructions to build and run the Docker images. 
2102,183,https://github.com/Kryndex/microservices-examples,## Building the images,3,Kryndex.microservices-examples.md,2, You can build the images by running the following command:  ``` ./build-docker-images.sh ```  This script is a simple wrapper around `docker build`. 
2103,183,https://github.com/Kryndex/microservices-examples,## Running the images,3,Kryndex.microservices-examples.md,2, You can now run the Docker images using the `docker-compose` command with `docker-compose-images.yml`:  ``` docker-compose -f docker-compose-images.yml up -d ```  The following command will wait until the services are available and displays the URLs:  ``` ./show-urls.sh ```

Make sure your computer has enough memory (most modern computers should be fine).  * We will only be using data from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02. One alternative is to read the data from just those dates rather than reading in the entire dataset and subsetting to those dates.  * You may find it useful to convert the Date and Time variables to Date/Time classes in R using the `strptime()` and `as.Date()` functions.  * Note that in this dataset missing values are coded as `?`.

Your task is to reconstruct the following plots below, all of which were constructed using the base plotting system.  First you will need to fork and clone the following GitHub repository: [https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1](https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1)   For each plot you should  * Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.  * Name each of the plot files as `plot1.png`, `plot2.png`, etc.  * Create a separate R code file (`plot1.R`, `plot2.R`, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in `plot1.R` constructs the `plot1.png` plot. Your code file **should include code for reading the data** so that the plot can be fully reproduced. You should also include the code that creates the PNG file.  * Add the PNG file and R code file to your git repository  When you are finished with the assignment, push your git repository to GitHub so that the GitHub version of your repository is up to date. There should be four PNG files and four R code files.   The four plots that you will need to construct are shown below.  "

Timings were collected on a system with an Intel i7-6900K 3.2 GHz, and ripgrep was compiled using the `compile` script in this repo.  Please remember that a single benchmark is never enough! See my [blog post on `ripgrep`](http://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/) for a very detailed comparison with more benchmarks and analysis.  | Tool | Command | Line count | Time | | ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- | | ripgrep (Unicode) | `rg -n -w '[A-Z]+_SUSPEND'` | 450 | **0.134s** | | [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) | `ag -w '[A-Z]+_SUSPEND'` | 450 | 0.753s | | [git grep](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-grep.html) | `LC_ALL=C git grep -E -n -w '[A-Z]+_SUSPEND'` | 450 | 0.823s | | [git grep (Unicode)](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-grep.html) | `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 git grep -E -n -w '[A-Z]+_SUSPEND'` | 450 | 2.880s | | [sift](https://github.com/svent/sift) | `sift --git -n -w '[A-Z]+_SUSPEND'` | 450 | 3.656s | | [The Platinum Searcher](https://github.com/monochromegane/the_platinum_searcher) | `pt -w -e '[A-Z]+_SUSPEND'` | 450 | 12.369s | | [ack](https://github.com/petdance/ack2) | `ack -w '[A-Z]+_SUSPEND'` | 1878 | 16.952s |  (Yes, `ack` [has](https://github.com/petdance/ack2/issues/445) a [bug](https://github.com/petdance/ack2/issues/14).)  Here's another benchmark that disregards gitignore files and searches with a whitelist instead. The corpus is the same as in the previous benchmark, and the flags passed to each command ensures that they are doing equivalent work:  | Tool | Command | Line count | Time | | ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- | | ripgrep | `rg -L -u -tc -n -w '[A-Z]+_SUSPEND'` | 404 | **0.108s** | | [ucg](https://github.com/gvansickle/ucg) | `ucg --type=cc -w '[A-Z]+_SUSPEND'` | 392 | 0.219s | | [GNU grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `egrep -R -n --include='*.c' --include='*.h' -w '[A-Z]+_SUSPEND'` | 404 | 0.733s |  (`ucg` [has slightly different behavior in the presence of symbolic links](https://github.com/gvansickle/ucg/issues/106).)  And finally, a straight up comparison between ripgrep and GNU grep on a single large file (~9.3GB, [`OpenSubtitles2016.raw.en.gz`](http://opus.lingfil.uu.se/OpenSubtitles2016/mono/OpenSubtitles2016.raw.en.gz)):  | Tool | Command | Line count | Time | | ---- | ------- | ---------- | ---- | | ripgrep | `rg -w 'Sherlock [A-Z]\w+'` | 5268 | **2.520s** | | [GNU grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) | `LC_ALL=C egrep -w 'Sherlock [A-Z]\w+'` | 5268 | 7.143s |  In the above benchmark, passing the `-n` flag (for showing line numbers) increases the times to `3.081s` for ripgrep and `11.403s` for GNU grep. "
2134,187,https://github.com/AlluringJay/ripgrep,### Why should I use `ripgrep`?,2,AlluringJay.ripgrep.md,3," * It can replace both The Silver Searcher and GNU grep because it is faster   than both. (N.B. It is not, strictly speaking, a ""drop-in"" replacement for   both, but the feature sets are far more similar than different.) * Like The Silver Searcher, `ripgrep` defaults to recursive directory search   and won't search files ignored by your `.gitignore` files. It also ignores   hidden and binary files by default. `ripgrep` also implements full support   for `.gitignore`, where as there are many bugs related to that functionality   in The Silver Searcher. * `ripgrep` can search specific types of files. For example, `rg -tpy foo`   limits your search to Python files and `rg -Tjs foo` excludes Javascript   files from your search. `ripgrep` can be taught about new file types with   custom matching rules. * `ripgrep` supports many features found in `grep`, such as showing the context   of search results, searching multiple patterns, highlighting matches with   color and full Unicode support. Unlike GNU grep, `ripgrep` stays fast while   supporting Unicode (which is always on).  In other words, use `ripgrep` if you like speed, sane defaults, fewer bugs and Unicode. "
2135,187,https://github.com/AlluringJay/ripgrep,### Is it really faster than everything else?,2,AlluringJay.ripgrep.md,3," Yes. A large number of benchmarks with detailed analysis for each is [available on my blog](http://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/).  Summarizing, `ripgrep` is fast because:  * It is built on top of   [Rust's regex engine](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/regex).   Rust's regex engine uses finite automata, SIMD and aggressive literal   optimizations to make searching very fast. * Rust's regex library maintains performance with full Unicode support by   building UTF-8 decoding directly into its deterministic finite automaton   engine. * It supports searching with either memory maps or by searching incrementally   with an intermediate buffer. The former is better for single files and the   latter is better for large directories. `ripgrep` chooses the best searching   strategy for you automatically. * Applies your ignore patterns in `.gitignore` files using a   [`RegexSet`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/regex/regex/struct.RegexSet.html).   That means a single file path can be matched against multiple glob patterns   simultaneously. * It uses a lock-free parallel recursive directory iterator, courtesy of   [`crossbeam`](https://docs.rs/crossbeam) and   [`ignore`](https://docs.rs/ignore). "
2136,187,https://github.com/AlluringJay/ripgrep,### Installation,3,AlluringJay.ripgrep.md,3," The binary name for `ripgrep` is `rg`.  [Binaries for `ripgrep` are available for Windows, Mac and Linux.](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases) Linux binaries are static executables. Windows binaries are available either as built with MinGW (GNU) or with Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC). When possible, prefer MSVC over GNU, but you'll need to have the [Microsoft VC++ 2015 redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145) installed.  If you're a **Mac OS X Homebrew** user, then you can install ripgrep either from homebrew-core, (compiled with rust stable, no SIMD):  ``` $ brew install ripgrep ```  or you can install a binary compiled with rust nightly (including SIMD and all optimizations) by utilizing a custom tap:  ``` $ brew tap burntsushi/ripgrep https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep.git $ brew install burntsushi/ripgrep/ripgrep-bin ```  If you're an **Arch Linux** user, then you can install `ripgrep` from the official repos:  ``` $ pacman -S ripgrep ```  If you're a **Gentoo** user, you can install `ripgrep` from the [official repo](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/sys-apps/ripgrep):  ``` $ emerge ripgrep ```  If you're a **Fedora 24+** user, you can install `ripgrep` from [copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/carlgeorge/ripgrep/):  ``` $ dnf copr enable carlgeorge/ripgrep $ dnf install ripgrep ```  If you're a **RHEL/CentOS 7** user, you can install `ripgrep` from [copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/carlgeorge/ripgrep/):  ``` $ yum-config-manager --add-repo=https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/carlgeorge/ripgrep/repo/epel-7/carlgeorge-ripgrep-epel-7.repo $ yum install ripgrep ```  If you're a **Nix** user, you can install `ripgrep` from [nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/tools/text/ripgrep/default.nix):  ``` $ nix-env --install ripgrep $ # (Or using the attribute name, which is also `ripgrep`.) ```  If you're a **Rust programmer**, `ripgrep` can be installed with `cargo`:  ``` $ cargo install ripgrep ```  `ripgrep` isn't currently in any other package repositories. [I'd like to change that](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/10). "
2137,187,https://github.com/AlluringJay/ripgrep,### Whirlwind tour,3,AlluringJay.ripgrep.md,3," The command line usage of `ripgrep` doesn't differ much from other tools that perform a similar function, so you probably already know how to use `ripgrep`. The full details can be found in `rg --help`, but let's go on a whirlwind tour.  `ripgrep` detects when its printing to a terminal, and will automatically colorize your output and show line numbers, just like The Silver Searcher. Coloring works on Windows too! Colors can be controlled more granularly with the `--color` flag.  One last thing before we get started: `ripgrep` assumes UTF-8 *everywhere*. It can still search files that are invalid UTF-8 (like, say, latin-1), but it will simply not work on UTF-16 encoded files or other more exotic encodings. [Support for other encodings may happen.](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1)  To recursively search the current directory, while respecting all `.gitignore` files, ignore hidden files and directories and skip binary files:  ``` $ rg foobar ```  The above command also respects all `.ignore` files, including in parent directories. `.ignore` files can be used when `.gitignore` files are insufficient. In all cases, `.ignore` patterns take precedence over `.gitignore`.  To ignore all ignore files, use `-u`. To additionally search hidden files and directories, use `-uu`. To additionally search binary files, use `-uuu`. (In other words, ""search everything, dammit!"") In particular, `rg -uuu` is similar to `grep -a -r`.  ``` $ rg -uu foobar  # similar to `grep -r` $ rg -uuu foobar  # similar to `grep -a -r` ```  (Tip: If your ignore files aren't being adhered to like you expect, run your search with the `--debug` flag.)  Make the search case insensitive with `-i`, invert the search with `-v` or show the 2 lines before and after every search result with `-C2`.  Force all matches to be surrounded by word boundaries with `-w`.  Search and replace (find first and last names and swap them):  ``` $ rg '([A-Z][a-z]+)\s+([A-Z][a-z]+)' --replace '$2, $1' ```  Named groups are supported:  ``` $ rg '(?P<first>[A-Z][a-z]+)\s+(?P<last>[A-Z][a-z]+)' --replace '$last, $first' ```  Up the ante with full Unicode support, by matching any uppercase Unicode letter followed by any sequence of lowercase Unicode letters (good luck doing this with other search tools!):  ``` $ rg '(\p{Lu}\p{Ll}+)\s+(\p{Lu}\p{Ll}+)' --replace '$2, $1' ```  Search only files matching a particular glob:  ``` $ rg foo -g 'README.*' ```  <!--*-->  Or exclude files matching a particular glob:  ``` $ rg foo -g '!*.min.js' ```  Search only HTML and CSS files:  ``` $ rg -thtml -tcss foobar ```  Search everything except for Javascript files:  ``` $ rg -Tjs foobar ```  To see a list of types supported, run `rg --type-list`. To add a new type, use `--type-add`, which must be accompanied by a pattern for searching (`rg` won't persist your type settings):  ``` $ rg --type-add 'foo:*.{foo,foobar}' -tfoo bar ```  The type `foo` will now match any file ending with the `.foo` or `.foobar` extensions. "
2138,187,https://github.com/AlluringJay/ripgrep,### Regex syntax,36,AlluringJay.ripgrep.md,3, The syntax supported is [documented as part of Rust's regex library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/regex/regex/index.html#syntax). 
2139,187,https://github.com/AlluringJay/ripgrep,### Building,3,AlluringJay.ripgrep.md,3," `ripgrep` is written in Rust, so you'll need to grab a [Rust installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/) in order to compile it. `ripgrep` compiles with Rust 1.9 (stable) or newer. Building is easy:  ``` $ git clone https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep $ cd ripgrep $ cargo build --release $ ./target/release/rg --version 0.1.3 ```  If you have a Rust nightly compiler, then you can enable optional SIMD acceleration like so:  ``` RUSTFLAGS=""-C target-cpu=native"" cargo build --release --features 'simd-accel avx-accel' ```  If your machine doesn't support AVX instructions, then simply remove `avx-accel` from the features list. Similarly for SIMD. "

2171,190,https://github.com/LittleSpider/GalleryFinal,## 具体使用,-,LittleSpider.GalleryFinal.md,2,"1、通过gradle把GalleryFinal添加到你的项目里  2、在你的Application中添加配置GallerFinal  ```java //设置主题 //ThemeConfig.CYAN ThemeConfig theme = new ThemeConfig.Builder()         ...         .build(); //配置功能 FunctionConfig functionConfig = new FunctionConfig.Builder()         .setEnableCamera(true)         .setEnableEdit(true)         .setEnableCrop(true)         .setEnableRotate(true)         .setCropSquare(true)         .setEnablePreview(true)         ...         .build();  //配置imageloader ImageLoader imageloader = new UILImageLoader(); CoreConfig coreConfig = new CoreConfig.Builder(context, imageloader, theme)         .setDebug(BuildConfig.DEBUG)         .setFunctionConfig(functionConfig)         ...         .build(); GalleryFinal.init(coreConfig); ```  3、选择图片加载器  * **UIL实现** [使用UniversalImageLoader点这里](https://github.com/pengjianbo/GalleryFinal/blob/master/app/src/main/java/cn/finalteam/galleryfinal/sample/loader/UILImageLoader.java)  * **Glide实现** [使用Glide点这里](https://github.com/pengjianbo/GalleryFinal/blob/master/app/src/main/java/cn/finalteam/galleryfinal/sample/loader/GlideImageLoader.java)  * **Picasso实现** [使用picasso点这里](https://github.com/pengjianbo/GalleryFinal/blob/master/app/src/main/java/cn/finalteam/galleryfinal/sample/loader/PicassoImageLoader.java)  * **fresco实现** [使用fresco点这里](https://github.com/pengjianbo/GalleryFinal/blob/master/app/src/main/java/cn/finalteam/galleryfinal/sample/loader/FrescoImageLoader.java)  * **xUtils3实现** [使用xUtils点这里](https://github.com/pengjianbo/GalleryFinal/blob/master/app/src/main/java/cn/finalteam/galleryfinal/sample/loader/XUtilsImageLoader.java)  * **xUitls2实现** [使用xUtils2点这里](https://github.com/pengjianbo/GalleryFinal/blob/master/app/src/main/java/cn/finalteam/galleryfinal/sample/loader/XUtils2ImageLoader.java)   * **自定义**  自定义步骤：  1)、实现ImageLoader接口  2)、在displayImage方法中实现图片加载，**这个需要注意的是一定要禁止缓存到本地和禁止缓存到内存**  3)、设置请求图片目标大小。displayImage方法中已经给出了width和height  4)、设置默认图和请求图片清晰度，建议把图片请求清晰度调整为Bitmap.Config.RGB_565避免出现OOM情况  * ……  4、启动GalleryFinal  在GalleryFinal 1.3.0版本中相册、拍照、裁剪和图片编辑功能可独立使用  **REQUEST_CODE_GALLERY 为请求码** **functionConfig 为功能配置** **mOnHanlderResultCallback 为请求回调**  * 单选打开相册  ```java GalleryFinal.openGallerySingle(REQUEST_CODE_GALLERY, mOnHanlderResultCallback); //带配置 GalleryFinal.openGallerySingle(REQUEST_CODE_GALLERY, functionConfig, mOnHanlderResultCallback);  ```  * 多选打开相册 ```java GalleryFinal.openGalleryMuti(REQUEST_CODE_GALLERY, mOnHanlderResultCallback); //带配置 FunctionConfig config = new FunctionConfig.Builder(MainActivity.this)     .setMutiSelectMaxSize(8)     .build(); GalleryFinal.openGalleryMuti(REQUEST_CODE_GALLERY, functionConfig, mOnHanlderResultCallback);  ```  * 使用拍照  ```java GalleryFinal.openCamera(REQUEST_CODE_CAMERA, mOnHanlderResultCallback); //带配置 GalleryFinal.openCamera(REQUEST_CODE_CAMERA, functionConfig, mOnHanlderResultCallback); ```  * 使用裁剪  ```java GalleryFinal.openCrop(REQUEST_CODE_CROP, mOnHanlderResultCallback);

StarryPy is a plugin-driven Starbound server wrapper that adds a great deal of functionality to Starbound. StarryPy3k  is written using asyncio is Python 3.  ***Please note this is still in very active development and is not ready to be used on general purpose servers. It should mostly work, but you have been forewarned.*** "
2186,192,https://github.com/AMorporkian/StarryPy3k,## Requirements,3,AMorporkian.StarryPy3k.md,2,"Python **3.4.4** or greater is required. Test are only conducted on Python versions 3.4 and 3.5.  While StarryPy3k **may** work with earlier version of Python, it is not recommended and will not be readily supported. "

While it is not strictly necessary, it is highly encouraged to  run your StarryPy3k instance from a virtual environment, as future plugins  may require more Python modules than are currently listed (eg - IRC3), and  using a virtual environment helps to keep a clean namespace and reduce the  chance of bugs. "
2188,192,https://github.com/AMorporkian/StarryPy3k,### Starbound Server Configuration,3,AMorporkian.StarryPy3k.md,3,"StarryPy works as a benevolent ""man in the middle"" between the Starbound game client and the Starbound dedicated server, in effect acting as a proxy server. As such, for easiest transition from a ""Vanilla"" server to one enhanced by StarryPy, you need to set your Starbound server to accept incoming connections on a new TCP port.  By default, this will be the port one lower than standard, to wit: 21024.  To accomplish this, edit your `starbound_server.config`.  Look for the lines below, and change them to specify port 21024:  ```   ""gameServerPort"" : 21025,   [...]   ""queryServerPort"" : 21025, ``` "
2189,192,https://github.com/AMorporkian/StarryPy3k,### StarryPy Proxy Configuration,3,AMorporkian.StarryPy3k.md,3,"An example configuration file, `config.json.default`, is provided in the `config` directory.  Copy that file to a new one named `config.json` in the same location.  Open it in your text editor of choice.  The following are the most likely changes you will have to make:  ```         ""irc_bot"": {             ""channel"": ""#YourChannel"",             ""log_irc"": false,             ""server"": ""irc.example.com"",             ""strip_colors"": true,             ""username"": ""Replace With Valid IRC Nick""         }, ```  This section controls the built-in IRC-to-Starbound bridge.  It will be active if you have the `irc3` Python module installed on your system.  Edit the sample values here to match your preferred IRC server, bot nick, et cetera.  Chat in the Starbound server will be relayed to the specified IRC channel, and vice versa.  You can also see who is on the server from IRC by saying `.who` in the IRC channel (we cannot use `/` as the command leader in IRC for obvious reasons.  ```         ""motd"": {             ""message"": ""Insert your MOTD message here. ^red;Note^reset; color codes work.""         },         ""new_player_greeters"": {             ""gifts"": {},             ""greeting"": ""This message will be displayed to players the first time StarryPy sees them connect.""         }, ```  The MOTD, or Message Of The Day, will be displayed to all players when they connect to the Starbound server.  You can update this in-game by using the `/set_motd` command.  The next section allows you to specify a message to be displayed to any players the first time they connect to the server.  You can also have StarryPy give items to new players by enumarating them in the `gifts` property.  Use Starbound's names for items as specified in its `.json` files.  ```         ""player_manager"": {             ""owner_uuid"": ""!--REPLACE WITH YOUR UUID--!"",             ""player_db"": ""config/player""         }, ```  Replace the obvious value here with your UUID.  This is how StarryPy will recognize you as the owner of the server and accord you the relevant rights and privileges.  You can find your UUID by watching the Starbound server log as you connect, by using the `list` RCON command, or by observing the names of your save files on the computer you use to play Starbound. "

Please feel free to open an issue on GitHub if you are having an error, or wish to make a suggestion. If you're feeling really motivated, fork the repo and contribute  some code.  In addition, plugin development is encouraged. There are still a few features missing from the core (particularly in the role system). A more comprehensive guide on plugin development is in the works. Please note that plugins will not work without modification from the original version of StarryPy.  If you would like to talk with other contributors/ask questions about development, please join #StarryPy on irc.freenode.net, or chat with us on [gitter](https://gitter.im/StarryPy). "

Due to personal circumstances, Carrots stepped away from the project.  After roughly 2 years of laying dormant, Kharidiron, having spent some time learning the ropes of StarryPy, decided to take the reigns on StarryPy3k. After many months of staring at the code (and many emails to CarrotsAreMediocre requesting assistance in understanding just what it is doing), is feeling a modicum more confident in handling this project and keeping it running."

It's a growing collection of samples with the goal of showing how to get things done using Cecil, as IL manipulation can sometime get tricky.  Read about the Cecil development on the [development log](http://cecil.pe).  To discuss Cecil, the best place is the [mono-cecil](https://groups.google.com/group/mono-cecil) Google Group.  Cecil is a project under the benevolent umbrella of the [.NET Foundation](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/).

2240,200,https://github.com/johnsonjr/vagrant-aws,## Features,1,johnsonjr.vagrant-aws.md,2, * Boot EC2 or VPC instances. * SSH into the instances. * Provision the instances with any built-in Vagrant provisioner. * Minimal synced folder support via `rsync`. * Define region-specific configurations so Vagrant can manage machines   in multiple regions. * Package running instances into new vagrant-aws friendly boxes 
2241,200,https://github.com/johnsonjr/vagrant-aws,## Usage,3,johnsonjr.vagrant-aws.md,2," Install using standard Vagrant 1.1+ plugin installation methods. After installing, `vagrant up` and specify the `aws` provider. An example is shown below.  ``` $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-aws ... $ vagrant up --provider=aws ... ```  Of course prior to doing this, you'll need to obtain an AWS-compatible box file for Vagrant. "
2242,200,https://github.com/johnsonjr/vagrant-aws,## Quick Start,3,johnsonjr.vagrant-aws.md,2," After installing the plugin (instructions above), the quickest way to get started is to actually use a dummy AWS box and specify all the details manually within a `config.vm.provider` block. So first, add the dummy box using any name you want:  ``` $ vagrant box add dummy https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws/raw/master/dummy.box ... ```  And then make a Vagrantfile that looks like the following, filling in your information where necessary.  ``` Vagrant.configure(""2"") do |config|   config.vm.box = ""dummy""    config.vm.provider :aws do |aws, override|     aws.access_key_id = ""YOUR KEY""     aws.secret_access_key = ""YOUR SECRET KEY""     aws.session_token = ""SESSION TOKEN""     aws.keypair_name = ""KEYPAIR NAME""      aws.ami = ""ami-7747d01e""      override.ssh.username = ""ubuntu""     override.ssh.private_key_path = ""PATH TO YOUR PRIVATE KEY""   end end ```  And then run `vagrant up --provider=aws`.  This will start an Ubuntu 12.04 instance in the us-east-1 region within your account. And assuming your SSH information was filled in properly within your Vagrantfile, SSH and provisioning will work as well.  Note that normally a lot of this boilerplate is encoded within the box file, but the box file used for the quick start, the ""dummy"" box, has no preconfigured defaults.  If you have issues with SSH connecting, make sure that the instances are being launched with a security group that allows SSH access. "
2243,200,https://github.com/johnsonjr/vagrant-aws,## Box Format,3,johnsonjr.vagrant-aws.md,2, Every provider in Vagrant must introduce a custom box format. This provider introduces `aws` boxes. You can view an example box in the [example_box/ directory](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws/tree/master/example_box). That directory also contains instructions on how to build a box.  The box format is basically just the required `metadata.json` file along with a `Vagrantfile` that does default settings for the provider-specific configuration for this provider. 
2244,200,https://github.com/johnsonjr/vagrant-aws,## Configuration,3,johnsonjr.vagrant-aws.md,2," This provider exposes quite a few provider-specific configuration options:  * `access_key_id` - The access key for accessing AWS * `ami` - The AMI id to boot, such as ""ami-12345678"" * `availability_zone` - The availability zone within the region to launch   the instance. If nil, it will use the default set by Amazon. * `instance_ready_timeout` - The number of seconds to wait for the instance   to become ""ready"" in AWS. Defaults to 120 seconds. * `instance_check_interval` - The number of seconds to wait to check the instance's  state * `instance_package_timeout` - The number of seconds to wait for the instance   to be burnt into an AMI during packaging. Defaults to 600 seconds. * `instance_type` - The type of instance, such as ""m3.medium"". The default   value of this if not specified is ""m3.medium"".  ""m1.small"" has been   deprecated in ""us-east-1"" and ""m3.medium"" is the smallest instance   type to support both paravirtualization and hvm AMIs * `keypair_name` - The name of the keypair to use to bootstrap AMIs    which support it. * `monitoring` - Set to ""true"" to enable detailed monitoring. * `session_token` - The session token provided by STS * `private_ip_address` - The private IP address to assign to an instance   within a [VPC](http://aws.amazon.com/vpc/) * `elastic_ip` - Can be set to 'true', or to an existing Elastic IP address.   If true, allocate a new Elastic IP address to the instance. If set   to an existing Elastic IP address, assign the address to the instance. * `region` - The region to start the instance in, such as ""us-east-1"" * `secret_access_key` - The secret access key for accessing AWS * `security_groups` - An array of security groups for the instance. If this   instance will be launched in VPC, this must be a list of security group   Name. For a nondefault VPC, you must use security group IDs instead (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.html). * `iam_instance_profile_arn` - The Amazon resource name (ARN) of the IAM Instance     Profile to associate with the instance * `iam_instance_profile_name` - The name of the IAM Instance Profile to associate   with the instance * `subnet_id` - The subnet to boot the instance into, for VPC. * `associate_public_ip` - If true, will associate a public IP address to an instance in a VPC. * `ssh_host_attribute` - If `:public_ip_address`, `:dns_name`, or   `:private_ip_address`, will use the public IP address, DNS name, or private   IP address, respectively, to SSH to the instance. By default Vagrant uses the   first of these (in this order) that is known. However, this can lead to   connection issues if, e.g., you are assigning a public IP address but your   security groups prevent public SSH access and require you to SSH in via the   private IP address; specify `:private_ip_address` in this case. * `tenancy` - When running in a VPC configure the tenancy of the instance.  Supports 'default' and 'dedicated'. * `tags` - A hash of tags to set on the machine. * `package_tags` - A hash of tags to set on the ami generated during the package operation. * `use_iam_profile` - If true, will use [IAM profiles](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/instance-profiles.html)   for credentials. * `block_device_mapping` - Amazon EC2 Block Device Mapping Property * `elb` - The ELB name to attach to the instance. * `unregister_elb_from_az` - Removes the ELB from the AZ on removal of the last instance if true (default). In non default VPC this has to be false. * `terminate_on_shutdown` - Indicates whether an instance stops or terminates   when you initiate shutdown from the instance.  These can be set like typical provider-specific configuration:  ```ruby Vagrant.configure(""2"") do |config|   # ... other stuff    config.vm.provider :aws do |aws|     aws.access_key_id = ""foo""     aws.secret_access_key = ""bar""   end end ```  In addition to the above top-level configs, you can use the `region_config` method to specify region-specific overrides within your Vagrantfile. Note that the top-level `region` config must always be specified to choose which region you want to actually use, however. This looks like this:  ```ruby Vagrant.configure(""2"") do |config|   # ... other stuff    config.vm.provider :aws do |aws|     aws.access_key_id = ""foo""     aws.secret_access_key = ""bar""     aws.region = ""us-east-1""      # Simple region config     aws.region_config ""us-east-1"", :ami => ""ami-12345678""      # More comprehensive region config     aws.region_config ""us-west-2"" do |region|       region.ami = ""ami-87654321""       region.keypair_name = ""company-west""     end   end end ```  The region-specific configurations will override the top-level configurations when that region is used. They otherwise inherit the top-level configurations, as you would probably expect. "
2245,200,https://github.com/johnsonjr/vagrant-aws,## Networks,3,johnsonjr.vagrant-aws.md,2," Networking features in the form of `config.vm.network` are not supported with `vagrant-aws`, currently. If any of these are specified, Vagrant will emit a warning, but will otherwise boot the AWS machine. "
2246,200,https://github.com/johnsonjr/vagrant-aws,## Synced Folders,3,johnsonjr.vagrant-aws.md,2," There is minimal support for synced folders. Upon `vagrant up`, `vagrant reload`, and `vagrant provision`, the AWS provider will use `rsync` (if available) to uni-directionally sync the folder to the remote machine over SSH.  See [Vagrant Synced folders: rsync](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/synced-folders/rsync.html)  "
2247,200,https://github.com/johnsonjr/vagrant-aws,## Other Examples,3,johnsonjr.vagrant-aws.md,2,
2248,200,https://github.com/johnsonjr/vagrant-aws,### Tags,3,johnsonjr.vagrant-aws.md,3," To use tags, simply define a hash of key/value for the tags you want to associate to your instance, like:  ```ruby Vagrant.configure(""2"") do |config|   # ... other stuff    config.vm.provider ""aws"" do |aws|     aws.tags = { 	  'Name' => 'Some Name', 	  'Some Key' => 'Some Value'     }   end end ``` "
2249,200,https://github.com/johnsonjr/vagrant-aws,### User data,3,johnsonjr.vagrant-aws.md,3," You can specify user data for the instance being booted.  ```ruby Vagrant.configure(""2"") do |config|   # ... other stuff    config.vm.provider ""aws"" do |aws|     # Option 1: a single string     aws.user_data = ""#!/bin/bash\necho 'got user data' > /tmp/user_data.log\necho""      # Option 2: use a file     aws.user_data = File.read(""user_data.txt"")   end end ``` "
2250,200,https://github.com/johnsonjr/vagrant-aws,### Disk size,3,johnsonjr.vagrant-aws.md,3," Need more space on your instance disk? Increase the disk size.  ```ruby Vagrant.configure(""2"") do |config|   # ... other stuff    config.vm.provider ""aws"" do |aws|     aws.block_device_mapping = [{ 'DeviceName' => '/dev/sda1', 'Ebs.VolumeSize' => 50 }]   end end ``` "
2251,200,https://github.com/johnsonjr/vagrant-aws,### ELB (Elastic Load Balancers),3,johnsonjr.vagrant-aws.md,3," You can automatically attach an instance to an ELB during boot and detach on destroy.  ```ruby Vagrant.configure(""2"") do |config|   # ... other stuff    config.vm.provider ""aws"" do |aws|     aws.elb = ""production-web""   end end ``` "
2252,200,https://github.com/johnsonjr/vagrant-aws,## Development,3,johnsonjr.vagrant-aws.md,2," To work on the `vagrant-aws` plugin, clone this repository out, and use [Bundler](http://gembundler.com) to get the dependencies:  ``` $ bundle ```  Once you have the dependencies, verify the unit tests pass with `rake`:  ``` $ bundle exec rake ```  If those pass, you're ready to start developing the plugin. You can test the plugin without installing it into your Vagrant environment by just creating a `Vagrantfile` in the top level of this directory (it is gitignored) and add the following line to your `Vagrantfile` ```ruby Vagrant.require_plugin ""vagrant-aws"" ``` Use bundler to execute Vagrant: ``` $ bundle exec vagrant up --provider=aws ```"

2254,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,## Intro,123,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,2,"-----  YouCompleteMe is a fast, as-you-type, fuzzy-search code completion engine for [Vim][]. It has several completion engines:  - an identifier-based engine that works with every programming language, - a [Clang][]-based engine that provides native semantic code   completion for C/C++/Objective-C/Objective-C++ (from now on referred to as   ""the C-family languages""), - a [Jedi][]-based completion engine for Python 2 and 3 (using the [JediHTTP][] wrapper), - an [OmniSharp][]-based completion engine for C#, - a combination of [Gocode][] and [Godef][] semantic engines for Go, - a [TSServer][]-based completion engine for TypeScript, - a [Tern][]-based completion engine for JavaScript, - a [racer][]-based completion engine for Rust, - and an omnifunc-based completer that uses data from Vim's omnicomplete system   to provide semantic completions for many other languages (Ruby, PHP etc.).  ![YouCompleteMe GIF demo](http://i.imgur.com/0OP4ood.gif)  Here's an explanation of what happens in the short GIF demo above.  First, realize that **no keyboard shortcuts had to be pressed** to get the list of completion candidates at any point in the demo. The user just types and the suggestions pop up by themselves. If the user doesn't find the completion suggestions relevant and/or just wants to type, they can do so; the completion engine will not interfere.  When the user sees a useful completion string being offered, they press the TAB key to accept it. This inserts the completion string. Repeated presses of the TAB key cycle through the offered completions.  If the offered completions are not relevant enough, the user can continue typing to further filter out unwanted completions.  A critical thing to notice is that the completion **filtering is NOT based on the input being a string prefix of the completion** (but that works too). The input needs to be a _[subsequence][] match_ of a completion. This is a fancy way of saying that any input characters need to be present in a completion string in the order in which they appear in the input. So `abc` is a subsequence of `xaybgc`, but not of `xbyxaxxc`. After the filter, a complicated sorting system ranks the completion strings so that the most relevant ones rise to the top of the menu (so you usually need to press TAB just once).  **All of the above works with any programming language** because of the identifier-based completion engine. It collects all of the identifiers in the current file and other files you visit (and your tags files) and searches them when you type (identifiers are put into per-filetype groups).  The demo also shows the semantic engine in use. When the user presses `.`, `->` or `::` while typing in insert mode (for C++; different triggers are used for other languages), the semantic engine is triggered (it can also be triggered with a keyboard shortcut; see the rest of the docs).  The last thing that you can see in the demo is YCM's diagnostic display features (the little red X that shows up in the left gutter; inspired by [Syntastic][]) if you are editing a C-family file. As Clang compiles your file and detects warnings or errors, they will be presented in various ways. You don't need to save your file or press any keyboard shortcut to trigger this, it ""just happens"" in the background.  In essence, YCM obsoletes the following Vim plugins because it has all of their features plus extra:  - clang_complete - AutoComplPop - Supertab - neocomplcache  **And that's not all...**  YCM also provides [semantic IDE-like features](#quick-feature-summary) in a number of languages, including:  - finding declarations, definitions, usages, etc. of identifiers, - displaying type information for classes, variables, functions etc., - displaying documentation for methods, members, etc. in the preview window, - fixing common coding errors, like missing semi-colons, typos, etc., - semantic renaming of variables across files (JavaScript only).  Features vary by file type, so make sure to check out the [file type feature summary](#quick-feature-summary) and the [full list of completer subcommands](#ycmcompleter-subcommands) to find out what's available for your favourite languages.  You'll also find that YCM has filepath completers (try typing `./` in a file) and a completer that integrates with [UltiSnips][]. "

2261,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### Full Installation Guide,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," These are the steps necessary to get YCM working on a Unix OS and on Windows.  **Note to Windows users:** we assume that you are running the `cmd.exe` command prompt and that the needed executables are in the PATH environment variable. Do not just copy the shell commands. Replace `~` by `%USERPROFILE%` in them and use the right Vim home directory. It should be `vimfiles` by default instead of `.vim`.  See the _FAQ_ if you have any issues.  **Remember:** YCM is a plugin with a compiled component. If you **update** YCM using Vundle and the ycm_core library APIs have changed (happens rarely), YCM will notify you to recompile it. You should then rerun the install process.  **Please follow the instructions carefully. Read EVERY WORD.**  1.  **Ensure that your version of Vim is _at least_ 7.3.598 _and_ that it has     support for Python 2 or Python 3 scripting**.      Inside Vim, type `:version`. Look at the first two to three lines of output;     it should say `Vi IMproved X.Y`, where X.Y is the major version of vim. If     your version is greater than 7.3, then you're all set. If your version is     7.3 then look below that where it says, `Included patches: 1-Z`, where Z     will be some number. That number needs to be 598 or higher.      If your version of Vim is not recent enough, you may need to [compile Vim     from source][vim-build] (don't worry, it's easy).      After you have made sure that you have Vim 7.3.598+, type the following in     Vim: `:echo has('python') || has('python3')`. The output should be 1. If     it's 0, then get a version of Vim with Python support.      On Windows, check also if your Vim architecture is 32 or 64-bit. This is     critical because it must match the Python and the YCM libraries     architectures. We recommend using a 64-bit Vim.  2.  **Install YCM** with [Vundle][] (or [Pathogen][], but Vundle is a better     idea). With Vundle, this would mean adding a `Plugin     'Valloric/YouCompleteMe'` line to your [vimrc][].      If you don't install YCM with Vundle, make sure you have run     `git submodule update --init --recursive` after checking out the YCM     repository (Vundle will do this for you) to fetch YCM's dependencies.  3.  [Complete this step ONLY if you care about semantic completion support for     C-family languages. Otherwise it's not necessary.]      **Download the latest version of `libclang`**. Clang is an open-source     compiler that can compile C/C++/Objective-C/Objective-C++. The `libclang`     library it provides is used to power the YCM semantic completion engine for     those languages. YCM is designed to work with libclang version 3.6 or     higher, but can in theory work with any 3.2+ version as well.      You can use the system libclang _only if you are sure it is version 3.3 or     higher_, otherwise don't. Even if it is, we recommend using the [official     binaries from llvm.org][clang-download] if at all possible. Make sure you     download the correct archive file for your OS.      We **STRONGLY recommend AGAINST use** of the system libclang instead of     the upstream compiled binaries. Random things may break. Save yourself the     hassle and use the upstream pre-built libclang.  4.  **Compile the `ycm_core` library** that YCM needs. This library     is the C++ engine that YCM uses to get fast completions.      You will need to have `cmake` installed in order to generate the required     makefiles. Linux users can install cmake with their package manager (`sudo     apt-get install cmake` for Ubuntu) whereas other users can [download and     install][cmake-download] cmake from its project site. Mac users can also get     it through [Homebrew][brew] with `brew install cmake`.      On a Unix OS, you need to make sure you have Python headers installed. On a     Debian-like Linux distro, this would be `sudo apt-get install python-dev     python3-dev`. On Mac they should already be present.      On Windows, you need to download and install [Python 2 or     Python 3][python-win-download]. Pick the version corresponding to your Vim     architecture. You will also need Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) to build YCM.     You can obtain it by installing [Visual Studio][visual-studio-download].     MSVC 11 (Visual Studio 2012), 12 (2013), and 14 (2015) are officially     supported.      Here we'll assume you installed YCM with Vundle. That means that the     top-level YCM directory is in `~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe`.      We'll create a new folder where build files will be placed. Run the     following:          cd ~         mkdir ycm_build         cd ycm_build      Now we need to generate the makefiles. If you DON'T care about semantic     support for C-family languages, run the following command in the `ycm_build`     directory:          cmake -G ""<generator>"" . ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/cpp      where `<generator>` is `Unix Makefiles` on Unix systems and one of the     following Visual Studio generators on Windows:      - `Visual Studio 11 Win64`     - `Visual Studio 12 Win64`     - `Visual Studio 14 Win64`      Remove the `Win64` part in these generators if your Vim architecture is     32-bit.      For those who want to use the system version of boost, you would pass     `-DUSE_SYSTEM_BOOST=ON` to cmake. This may be necessary on some systems     where the bundled version of boost doesn't compile out of the box.      NOTE: We **STRONGLY recommend AGAINST use** of the system boost instead     of the bundled version of boost. Random things may break. Save yourself     the hassle and use the bundled version of boost.      If you DO care about semantic support for C-family languages, then your     `cmake` call will be a bit more complicated.  We'll assume you downloaded a     binary distribution of LLVM+Clang from llvm.org in step 3 and that you     extracted the archive file to folder `~/ycm_temp/llvm_root_dir` (with `bin`,     `lib`, `include` etc. folders right inside that folder). On Windows, you can     extract the files from the LLVM+Clang installer using [7-zip][7z-download].      NOTE: This _only_ works with a _downloaded_ LLVM binary package, not a     custom-built LLVM! See docs below for `EXTERNAL_LIBCLANG_PATH` when using a     custom LLVM build.      With that in mind, run the following command in the `ycm_build` directory:          cmake -G ""<generator>"" -DPATH_TO_LLVM_ROOT=~/ycm_temp/llvm_root_dir . ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/cpp      where `<generator>` is replaced like above.      Now that configuration files have been generated, compile the libraries     using this command:          cmake --build . --target ycm_core --config Release      The `--config Release` part is specific to Windows and will be ignored on a     Unix OS.      For those who want to use the system version of libclang, you would pass     `-DUSE_SYSTEM_LIBCLANG=ON` to cmake _instead of_ the     `-DPATH_TO_LLVM_ROOT=...` flag.      NOTE: We **STRONGLY recommend AGAINST use** of the system libclang instead     of the upstream compiled binaries. Random things may break. Save yourself     the hassle and use the upstream pre-built libclang.      You could also force the use of a custom libclang library with     `-DEXTERNAL_LIBCLANG_PATH=/path/to/libclang.so` flag (the library would end     with `.dylib` on a Mac). Again, this flag would be used _instead of_ the     other flags. **If you compiled LLVM from source, this is the flag you should     be using.**      Running the `cmake` command will also place the `libclang.[so|dylib|dll]` in     the `YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd` folder for you if you compiled with     clang support (it needs to be there for YCM to work).  5. Set up support for additional languages, as desired:    - C# support: Navigate to     `YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/third_party/OmniSharpServer` and run     `msbuild` (Windows) or `xbuild` (other platforms, using mono) depending on     your platform. If mono is not installed, install it.     When on Windows, be sure that [the build utility `msbuild` is in your PATH][add-msbuild-to-path].    - Go support: If go is not installed on your system, install it and add it to     your path. Navigate to `YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/third_party/gocode`     and run `go build`.    - TypeScript support: As with the quick installation, simply `npm install -g     typescript` after successfully installing [nodejs and npm][npm-install].    - JavaScript support: Install [nodejs and npm][npm-install]. Then navigate to     `YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/third_party/tern_runtime` and run `npm install     --production`    - Rust support: Install [rustc and cargo][rust-install]. Navigate to     `YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/third_party/racerd` and run     `cargo build --release`.  That's it. You're done. Refer to the _User Guide_ section on how to use YCM. Don't forget that if you want the C-family semantic completion engine to work, you will need to provide the compilation flags for your project to YCM. It's all in the User Guide.  YCM comes with sane defaults for its options, but you still may want to take a look at what's available for configuration. There are a few interesting options that are conservatively turned off by default that you may want to turn on. "

2272,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### General Usage,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," - If the offered completions are too broad, keep typing characters; YCM will   continue refining the offered completions based on your input. - Filtering is ""smart-case"" sensitive; if you are typing only lowercase letters,   then it's case-insensitive. If your input contains uppercase letters, then the   uppercase letters in your query must match uppercase letters in the completion   strings (the lowercase letters still match both). So, ""foo"" matches ""Foo"" and   ""foo"", ""Foo"" matches ""Foo"" and ""FOO"" but not ""foo"". - Use the TAB key to accept a completion and continue pressing TAB to cycle   through the completions. Use Shift-TAB to cycle backwards. Note that if you're   using console Vim (that is, not Gvim or MacVim) then it's likely that the   Shift-TAB binding will not work because the console will not pass it to Vim.   You can remap the keys; see the _[Options][]_ section below.  Knowing a little bit about how YCM works internally will prevent confusion. YCM has several completion engines: an identifier-based completer that collects all of the identifiers in the current file and other files you visit (and your tags files) and searches them when you type (identifiers are put into per-filetype groups).  There are also several semantic engines in YCM. There's a libclang-based completer that provides semantic completion for C-family languages.  There's a Jedi-based completer for semantic completion for Python. There's also an omnifunc-based completer that uses data from Vim's omnicomplete system to provide semantic completions when no native completer exists for that language in YCM.  There are also other completion engines, like the UltiSnips completer and the filepath completer.  YCM automatically detects which completion engine would be the best in any situation. On occasion, it queries several of them at once, merges the outputs and presents the results to you. "
2273,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### Client-Server Architecture,36,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3, YCM has a client-server architecture; the Vim part of YCM is only a thin client that talks to the [ycmd HTTP+JSON server][ycmd] that has the vast majority of YCM logic and functionality. The server is started and stopped automatically as you start and stop Vim. 
2274,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### Completion String Ranking,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," The subsequence filter removes any completions that do not match the input, but then the sorting system kicks in. It's actually very complicated and uses lots of factors, but suffice it to say that ""word boundary"" (WB) subsequence character matches are ""worth"" more than non-WB matches. In effect, this means given an input of ""gua"", the completion ""getUserAccount"" would be ranked higher in the list than the ""Fooguxa"" completion (both of which are subsequence matches). A word-boundary character are all capital characters, characters preceded by an underscore and the first letter character in the completion string. "
2275,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### General Semantic Completion,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," - You can use Ctrl+Space to trigger the completion suggestions anywhere, even   without a string prefix. This is useful to see which top-level functions are   available for use. "
2276,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### C-family Semantic Completion,36,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," YCM looks for a `.ycm_extra_conf.py` file in the directory of the opened file or in any directory above it in the hierarchy (recursively); when the file is found, it is loaded (only once!) as a Python module. YCM calls a `FlagsForFile` method in that module which should provide it with the information necessary to compile the current file. You can also provide a path to a global `.ycm_extra_conf.py` file, which will be used as a fallback. To prevent the execution of malicious code from a file you didn't write YCM will ask you once per `.ycm_extra_conf.py` if it is safe to load. This can be disabled and you can white-/blacklist files. See the _Options_ section for more details.  This system was designed this way so that the user can perform any arbitrary sequence of operations to produce a list of compilation flags YCM should hand to Clang.  [See YCM's own `.ycm_extra_conf.py`][flags_example] for details on how this works. You should be able to use it _as a starting point_. **Don't** just copy/paste that file somewhere and expect things to magically work; **your project needs different flags**. Hint: just replace the strings in the `flags` variable with compilation flags necessary for your project. That should be enough for 99% of projects.  Yes, [Clang's `CompilationDatabase` system][compdb] is also supported. Again, see the above linked example file. You can get CMake to generate this file for you by adding `set( CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS 1 )` to your project's `CMakeLists.txt` file (if using CMake). If you're not using CMake, you could use something like [Bear][] to generate the `compile_commands.json` file.  Consider using [YCM-Generator][ygen] to generate the `ycm_extra_conf.py` file.  If Clang encounters errors when compiling the header files that your file includes, then it's probably going to take a long time to get completions.  When the completion menu finally appears, it's going to have a large number of unrelated completion strings (type/function names that are not actually members). This is because Clang fails to build a precompiled preamble for your file if there are any errors in the included headers and that preamble is key to getting fast completions.  Call the `:YcmDiags` command to see if any errors or warnings were detected in your file. "
2277,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### JavaScript Semantic Completion,36,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3,
2278,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,#### Quick start,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,4," 1. Ensure that you have enabled the Tern completer. See the    [installation guide](#installation) for details.  2. Create a `.tern-project` file in the root directory of your JavaScript    project, by following the [instructions][tern-project] in the [Tern][]    documentation.  3. Make sure that Vim's working directory is a descendent of that directory (or    that directory itself) when working with JavaScript files. "
2279,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,#### Explanation,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,4," JavaScript completion is based on [Tern][]. This completion engine requires a file named [`.tern-project`][tern-project] to exist in the current working directory or a directory which is an ancestor of the current working directory when the tern server is started. YCM starts the Tern server the first time a JavaScript file is edited, so Vim's working directory at that time needs to be a descendent of the directory containing the `.tern-project` file (or that directory itself).  Alternatively, as described in the [Tern documentation][tern-docs], a global `.tern-config` file may be used.  Multiple Tern servers, are not supported. To switch to a different JavaScript project, you can do one of the following:  - start a new instance of Vim from the new project's directory - change Vim's working directory (`:cd /path/to/new/project`) and restart the   [ycmd server][ycmd] (`:YcmRestartServer`) - change Vim's working directory (`:cd /path/to/new/project`), open a JavaScript   file (or set filetype to JavaScript) and restart the Tern server using YCM   completer subcommands `:YcmCompleter StopServer` and `:YcmCompleter   StartServer`. "
2280,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,#### Tips and tricks,36,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,4," This section contains some advice for configuring `.tern-project` and working with JavaScript files. The canonical reference for correctly configuring Tern is the [Tern documentation][tern-docs]. Any issues, improvements, advice, etc. should be sought from the [Tern][] project. For example, see the [list of tern plugins](http://ternjs.net/doc/manual.html#plugins) for the list of plugins which can be enabled in the `plugins` section of the `.tern-project` file. "
2281,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,##### Configuring Tern for node support,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,5," The following simple example `.tern-project` file enables nodejs support:  ```json {     ""plugins"": {         ""node"": {}     } }  ``` "
2282,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,##### Configuring Tern for requirejs support,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,5," The Tern requirejs plugin requires that all included ""libraries"" are rooted under the same base directory. If that's not the case for your projects, then it is possible to make it work with appropriate symbolic links. For example, create a directory `ext_lib` within your project and populate it with symlinks to your libraries. Then set up the `.tern-project` something like this:  ```json  {   ""plugins"": {     ""requirejs"": {       ""baseURL"": ""./ext_lib"",     }   } } ```  Then, given the following structure:  ``` ./ext_lib/mylib (symlink) ./ext_lib/anotherlib (symlink) ```  Can be used as follows:  ```javascript define( [ 'mylib/file1', 'anotherlib/anotherfile' ], function( f1, f2 ) {     // etc. } ); ``` "
2283,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### Rust Semantic Completion,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," Completions and GoTo commands within the current crate and its dependencies should work out of the box with no additional configuration (provided that you built YCM with the `--racer-completer` flag; see the [*Installation* section](#installation) for details).  For semantic analysis inclusive of the standard library, you must have a local copy of [the rust source code][rust-src]. You also need to set the following option so YouCompleteMe can locate it.  ```viml "" In this example, the rust source code zip has been extracted to "" /usr/local/rust/rustc-1.5.0 let g:ycm_rust_src_path = '/usr/local/rust/rustc-1.5.0/src' ``` "
2284,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### Python Semantic Completion,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," Completion and GoTo commands work out of the box with no additional configuration. Those features are provided by the [jedi][] library which supports a variety of Python versions (2.6, 2.7, 3.2+) as long as it runs in the corresponding Python interpreter. By default YCM runs [jedi][] with the same Python interpreter used by the [ycmd server][ycmd], so if you would like to use a different interpreter, use the following option specifying the Python binary to use. For example, to provide Python 3 completion in your project, set:  ```viml let g:ycm_python_binary_path = '/usr/bin/python3' ``` "
2285,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### Semantic Completion for Other Languages,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," Python, C#, Go, Rust, and TypeScript are supported natively by YouCompleteMe using the [Jedi][], [Omnisharp][], [Gocode][], [racer][], and [TSServer][] engines, respectively. Check the [installation](#installation) section for instructions to enable these features if desired.  YCM will use your `omnifunc` (see `:h omnifunc` in Vim) as a source for semantic completions if it does not have a native semantic completion engine for your file's filetype. Vim comes with okayish omnifuncs for various languages like Ruby, PHP etc. It depends on the language.  You can get stellar omnifuncs for Java and Ruby with [Eclim][]. Just make sure you have the _latest_ Eclim installed and configured (this means Eclim `>= 2.2.*` and Eclipse `>= 4.2.*`).  After installing Eclim remember to create a new Eclipse project within your application by typing `:ProjectCreate <path-to-your-project> -n ruby` (or `-n java`) inside vim and don't forget to have `let g:EclimCompletionMethod = 'omnifunc'` in your vimrc. This will make YCM and Eclim play nice; YCM will use Eclim's omnifuncs as the data source for semantic completions and provide the auto-triggering and subsequence-based matching (and other YCM features) on top of it. "
2286,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### Writing New Semantic Completers,36,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," You have two options here: writing an `omnifunc` for Vim's omnicomplete system that YCM will then use through its omni-completer, or a custom completer for YCM using the [Completer API][completer-api].  Here are the differences between the two approaches:  - You have to use VimScript to write the omnifunc, but get to use Python to   write for the Completer API; this by itself should make you want to use the   API. - The Completer API is a _much_ more powerful way to integrate with YCM and it   provides a wider set of features. For instance, you can make your Completer   query your semantic back-end in an asynchronous fashion, thus not blocking   Vim's GUI thread while your completion system is processing stuff. This is   impossible with VimScript. All of YCM's completers use the Completer API. - Performance with the Completer API is better since Python executes faster than   VimScript.  If you want to use the `omnifunc` system, see the relevant Vim docs with `:h complete-functions`. For the Completer API, see [the API docs][completer-api].  If you want to upstream your completer into YCM's source, you should use the Completer API. "
2287,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### Diagnostic Display,36,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," YCM will display diagnostic notifications for C-family and C# languages if you compiled YCM with Clang and Omnisharp support, respectively. Since YCM continuously recompiles your file as you type, you'll get notified of errors and warnings in your file as fast as possible.  Here are the various pieces of the diagnostic UI:  - Icons show up in the Vim gutter on lines that have a diagnostic. - Regions of text related to diagnostics are highlighted (by default, a red   wavy underline in `gvim` and a red background in `vim`). - Moving the cursor to a line with a diagnostic echoes the diagnostic text. - Vim's location list is automatically populated with diagnostic data (off by   default, see options).  The new diagnostics (if any) will be displayed the next time you press any key on the keyboard. So if you stop typing and just wait for the new diagnostics to come in, that _will not work_. You need to press some key for the GUI to update.  Having to press a key to get the updates is unfortunate, but cannot be changed due to the way Vim internals operate; there is no way that a background task can update Vim's GUI after it has finished running.  You _have to_ press a key. This will make YCM check for any pending diagnostics updates.  You _can_ force a full, blocking compilation cycle with the `:YcmForceCompileAndDiagnostics` command (you may want to map that command to a key; try putting `nnoremap <F5> :YcmForceCompileAndDiagnostics<CR>` in your vimrc). Calling this command will force YCM to immediately recompile your file and display any new diagnostics it encounters. Do note that recompilation with this command may take a while and during this time the Vim GUI _will_ be blocked.  YCM will display a short diagnostic message when you move your cursor to the line with the error. You can get a detailed diagnostic message with the `<leader>d` key mapping (can be changed in the options) YCM provides when your cursor is on the line with the diagnostic.  You can also see the full diagnostic message for all the diagnostics in the current file in Vim's `locationlist`, which can be opened with the `:lopen` and `:lclose` commands (make sure you have set `let g:ycm_always_populate_location_list = 1` in your vimrc). A good way to toggle the display of the `locationlist` with a single key mapping is provided by another (very small) Vim plugin called [ListToggle][] (which also makes it possible to change the height of the `locationlist` window), also written by yours truly. "
2288,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,#### Diagnostic Highlighting Groups,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,4," You can change the styling for the highlighting groups YCM uses. For the signs in the Vim gutter, the relevant groups are:  - `YcmErrorSign`, which falls back to group `SyntasticErrorSign` and then   `error` if they exist - `YcmWarningSign`, which falls back to group `SyntasticWarningSign` and then   `todo` if they exist  You can also style the line that has the warning/error with these groups:  - `YcmErrorLine`, which falls back to group `SyntasticErrorLine` if it exists - `YcmWarningLine`, which falls back to group `SyntasticWarningLine` if it   exists  Note that the line highlighting groups only work when gutter signs are turned on.  The syntax groups used to highlight regions of text with errors/warnings: - `YcmErrorSection`, which falls back to group `SyntasticError` if it exists and   then `SpellBad` - `YcmWarningSection`, which falls back to group `SyntasticWarning` if it exists   and then `SpellCap`  Here's how you'd change the style for a group:  ```viml highlight YcmErrorLine guibg=#3f0000 ``` "

2290,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `:YcmRestartServer` command,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," If the [ycmd completion server][ycmd] suddenly stops for some reason, you can restart it with this command. "
2291,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `:YcmForceCompileAndDiagnostics` command,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3, Calling this command will force YCM to immediately recompile your file and display any new diagnostics it encounters. Do note that recompilation with this command may take a while and during this time the Vim GUI _will_ be blocked.  You may want to map this command to a key; try putting `nnoremap <F5> :YcmForceCompileAndDiagnostics<CR>` in your vimrc. 
2292,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `:YcmDiags` command,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," Calling this command will fill Vim's `locationlist` with errors or warnings if any were detected in your file and then open it. If a given error or warning can be fixed by a call to `:YcmCompleter FixIt`, then ` (FixIt available)` is appended to the error or warning text. See the `FixIt` completer subcommand for more information.  NOTE: The absense of ` (FixIt available)` does not strictly imply a fix-it is not available as not all completers are able to provide this indication. For example, the c-sharp completer provides many fix-its but does not add this additional indication.  The `g:ycm_open_loclist_on_ycm_diags` option can be used to prevent the location list from opening, but still have it filled with new diagnostic data. See the _Options_ section for details. "
2293,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `:YcmShowDetailedDiagnostic` command,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3, This command shows the full diagnostic text when the user's cursor is on the line with the diagnostic. 
2294,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `:YcmDebugInfo` command,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3, This will print out various debug information for the current file. Useful to see what compile commands will be used for the file if you're using the semantic completion engine. 
2295,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `:YcmToggleLogs` command,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," This command automatically opens in windows the stdout and stderr logfiles written by the [ycmd server][ycmd]. If one or both logfiles are already opened, they are automatically closed. `stderr` or `stdout` can be specified as an argument of this command to only open the corresponding logfile instead of both. If this logfile is already opened, it will be closed. Only for debugging purpose. "
2296,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `:YcmCompleter` command,36,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," This command gives access to a number of additional [IDE-like features](#quick-feature-summary) in YCM, for things like semantic GoTo, type information, FixIt and refactoring.  Technically the command invokes completer-specific commands.  If the first argument is of the form `ft=...` the completer for that file type will be used (for example `ft=cpp`), else the native completer of the current buffer will be used. Call `YcmCompleter` without further arguments for a list of the commands you can call for the current completer.  See the [file type feature summary](#quick-feature-summary) for an overview of the features available for each file type. See the _YcmCompleter subcommands_ section for more information on the available subcommands and their usage. "
2297,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,## YcmCompleter Subcommands,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,2,"------------------------  NOTE: See the docs for the `YcmCompleter` command before tackling this section.  The invoked subcommand is automatically routed to the currently active semantic completer, so `:YcmCompleter GoToDefinition` will invoke the `GoToDefinition` subcommand on the Python semantic completer if the currently active file is a Python one and on the Clang completer if the currently active file is a C/C++/Objective-C one.  You may also want to map the subcommands to something less verbose; for instance, `nnoremap <leader>jd :YcmCompleter GoTo<CR>` maps the `<leader>jd` sequence to the longer subcommand invocation. "
2298,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### GoTo Commands,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," These commands are useful for jumping around and exploring code. When moving the cursor, the subcommands add entries to Vim's `jumplist` so you can use `CTRL-O` to jump back to where you where before invoking the command (and `CTRL-I` to jump forward; see `:h jumplist` for details).

NOTE: For C-family languages **this only works in certain situations**, namely when the definition of the symbol is in the current translation unit. A translation unit consists of the file you are editing and all the files you are including with `#include` directives (directly or indirectly) in that file.  Supported in filetypes: `c, cpp, objc, objcpp, cs, go, javascript, python, rust, typescript` "
2302,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,#### The `GoTo` subcommand,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,4," This command tries to perform the ""most sensible"" GoTo operation it can. Currently, this means that it tries to look up the symbol under the cursor and jumps to its definition if possible; if the definition is not accessible from the current translation unit, jumps to the symbol's declaration. For C/C++/Objective-C, it first tries to look up the current line for a header and jump to it. For C#, implementations are also considered and preferred.  Supported in filetypes: `c, cpp, objc, objcpp, cs, go, javascript, python, rust` "
2303,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,#### The `GoToImprecise` subcommand,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,4," WARNING: This command trades correctness for speed!  Same as the `GoTo` command except that it doesn't recompile the file with libclang before looking up nodes in the AST. This can be very useful when you're editing files that take long to compile but you know that you haven't made any changes since the last parse that would lead to incorrect jumps. When you're just browsing around your codebase, this command can spare you quite a bit of latency.  Supported in filetypes: `c, cpp, objc, objcpp` "
2304,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,#### The `GoToReferences` subcommand,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,4," This command attempts to find all of the references within the project to the identifier under the cursor and populates the quickfix list with those locations.

2308,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,#### The `GetType` subcommand,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,4," Echos the type of the variable or method under the cursor, and where it differs, the derived type.  For example:  ```c++     std::string s; ```  Invoking this command on `s` returns `std::string => std::basic_string<char>`  NOTE: Due to limitations of `libclang`, invoking this command on the word `auto` typically returns `auto`. However, invoking it on a usage of the variable with inferred type returns the correct type, but typically it is repeated due to `libclang` returning that the types differ.  For example:  ```c++ const char *s = ""String""; auto x = &s; // invoking on x or auto returns ""auto"";              // invoking on s returns ""const char *"" std::cout << *x; // invoking on x returns ""const char ** => const char **"" ```  NOTE: Causes re-parsing of the current translation unit.  Supported in filetypes: `c, cpp, objc, objcpp, javascript, typescript` "
2309,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,#### The `GetParent` subcommand,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,4," Echos the semantic parent of the point under the cursor.  The semantic parent is the item that semantically contains the given position.  For example:  ```c++ class C {     void f(); };  void C::f() {  } ```  In the out-of-line definition of `C::f`, the semantic parent is the class `C`, of which this function is a member.  In the example above, both declarations of `C::f` have `C` as their semantic context, while the lexical context of the first `C::f` is `C` and the lexical context of the second `C::f` is the translation unit.  For global declarations, the semantic parent is the translation unit.  NOTE: Causes re-parsing of the current translation unit.  Supported in filetypes: `c, cpp, objc, objcpp` "
2310,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,#### The `GetDoc` subcommand,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,4," Displays the preview window populated with quick info about the identifier under the cursor.

2311,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### Refactoring and FixIt Commands,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," These commands make changes to your source code in order to perform refactoring or code correction. YouCompleteMe does not perform any action which cannot be undone, and never saves or writes files to the disk. "
2312,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,#### The `FixIt` subcommand,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,4," Where available, attempts to make changes to the buffer to correct the diagnostic closest to the cursor position.  Completers which provide diagnostics may also provide trivial modifications to the source in order to correct the diagnostic. Examples include syntax errors such as missing trailing semi-colons, spurious characters, or other errors which the semantic engine can deterministically suggest corrections.  If no fix-it is available for the current line, or there is no diagnostic on the current line, this command has no effect on the current buffer. If any modifications are made, the number of changes made to the buffer is echo'd and the user may use the editor's undo command to revert.  When a diagnostic is available, and `g:ycm_echo_current_diagnostic` is set to 1, then the text ` (FixIt)` is appended to the echo'd diagnostic when the completer is able to add this indication. The text ` (FixIt available)` is also appended to the diagnostic text in the output of the `:YcmDiags` command for any diagnostics with available fix-its (where the completer can provide this indication).  NOTE: Causes re-parsing of the current translation unit.  NOTE: After applying a fix-it, the diagnostics UI is not immediately updated. This is due to a technical restriction in Vim. Moving the cursor, or issuing the `:YcmForceCompileAndDiagnostics` command will refresh the diagnostics. Repeated invocations of the `FixIt` command on a given line, however, _do_ apply all diagnostics as expected without requiring refreshing of the diagnostics UI. This is particularly useful where there are multiple diagnostics on one line, or where after fixing one diagnostic, another fix-it is available.  Supported in filetypes: `c, cpp, objc, objcpp, cs` "
2313,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,#### The `RefactorRename <new name>` subcommand,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,4," In supported file types, this command attempts to perform a semantic rename of the identifier under the cursor. This includes renaming declarations, definitions and usages of the identifier, or any other language-appropriate action. The specific behavior is defined by the semantic engine in use.  Similar to `FixIt`, this command applies automatic modifications to your source files. Rename operations may involve changes to multiple files, which may or may not be open in Vim buffers at the time. YouCompleteMe handles all of this for you. The behavior is described in [the following section](#multi-file-refactor).  Supported in filetypes: `javascript` (variables only) "
2314,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,#### Multi-file Refactor,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,4," When a Refactor or FixIt command touches multiple files, YouCompleteMe attempts to apply those modifications to any existing open, visible buffer in the current tab. If no such buffer can be found, YouCompleteMe opens the file in a new small horizontal split at the top of the current window, applies the change, and then *hides* the window. NOTE: The buffer remains open, and must be manually saved. A confirmation dialog is opened prior to doing this to remind you that this is about to happen.  Once the modifications have been made, the quickfix list (see `:help quickfix`) is opened and populated with the locations of all modifications. This can be used to review all automatic changes made. Typically, use the `CTRL-W <enter>` combination to open the selected file in a new split.  The buffers are *not* saved automatically. That is, you must save the modified buffers manually after reviewing the changes from the quickfix list. Changes can be undone using Vim's powerful undo features (see `:help undo`). Note that Vim's undo is per-buffer, so to undo all changes, the undo commands must be applied in each modified buffer separately.  NOTE: While applying modifications, Vim may find files which are already open and have a swap file. The command is aborted if you select Abort or Quit in any such prompts. This leaves the Refactor operation partially complete and must be manually corrected using Vim's undo features. The quickfix list is *not* populated in this case. Inspect `:buffers` or equivalent (see `:help buffers`) to see the buffers that were opened by the command. "
2315,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### Miscellaneous Commands,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," These commands are for general administration, rather than IDE-like features. They cover things like the semantic engine server instance and compilation flags. "
2316,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,#### The `ClearCompilationFlagCache` subcommand,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,4," YCM caches the flags it gets from the `FlagsForFile` function in your `ycm_extra_conf.py` file if you return them with the `do_cache` parameter set to `True`. The cache is in memory and is never invalidated (unless you restart Vim of course).  This command clears that cache entirely. YCM will then re-query your `FlagsForFile` function as needed in the future.  Supported in filetypes: `c, cpp, objc, objcpp` "
2317,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,#### The `StartServer` subcommand,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,4," Starts the semantic-engine-as-localhost-server for those semantic engines that work as separate servers that YCM talks to.

2322,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `youcompleteme#GetErrorCount` function,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," Get the number of YCM Diagnostic errors. If no errors are present, this function returns 0.  For example: ```viml   call youcompleteme#GetErrorCount() ```  Both this function and `youcompleteme#GetWarningCount` can be useful when integrating YCM with other Vim plugins. For example, a [lightline][] user could add a diagnostics section to their statusline which would display the number of errors and warnings. "
2323,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `youcompleteme#GetWarningCount` function,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," Get the number of YCM Diagnostic warnings. If no warnings are present, this function returns 0.  For example: ```viml   call youcompleteme#GetWarningCount() ```  "
2324,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,## Options,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,2,-------  All options have reasonable defaults so if the plug-in works after installation you don't need to change any options. These options can be configured in your [vimrc script][vimrc] by including a line like this:  ```viml let g:ycm_min_num_of_chars_for_completion = 1 ```  Note that after changing an option in your [vimrc script] [vimrc] you have to restart Vim for the changes to take effect. 
2325,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_min_num_of_chars_for_completion` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," This option controls the number of characters the user needs to type before identifier-based completion suggestions are triggered. For example, if the option is set to `2`, then when the user types a second alphanumeric character after a whitespace character, completion suggestions will be triggered. This option is NOT used for semantic completion.  Setting this option to a high number like `99` effectively turns off the identifier completion engine and just leaves the semantic engine.  Default: `2`  ```viml let g:ycm_min_num_of_chars_for_completion = 2 ``` "
2326,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_min_num_identifier_candidate_chars` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3, This option controls the minimum number of characters that a completion candidate coming from the identifier completer must have to be shown in the popup menu.  A special value of `0` means there is no limit.  NOTE: This option only applies to the identifier completer; it has no effect on the various semantic completers.  Default: `0`  ```viml let g:ycm_min_num_identifier_candidate_chars = 0 ``` 
2327,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_auto_trigger` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," When set to `0`, this option turns off YCM's identifier completer (the as-you-type popup) _and_ the semantic triggers (the popup you'd get after typing `.` or `->` in say C++). You can still force semantic completion with the `<C-Space>` shortcut.  If you want to just turn off the identifier completer but keep the semantic triggers, you should set `g:ycm_min_num_of_chars_for_completion` to a high number like `99`.  Default: `1`  ```viml let g:ycm_auto_trigger = 1 ``` "
2328,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_filetype_whitelist` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," This option controls for which Vim filetypes (see `:h filetype`) should YCM be turned on. The option value should be a Vim dictionary with keys being filetype strings (like `python`, `cpp` etc) and values being unimportant (the dictionary is used like a hash set, meaning that only the keys matter).  The `*` key is special and matches all filetypes. By default, the whitelist contains only this `*` key.  YCM also has a `g:ycm_filetype_blacklist` option that lists filetypes for which YCM shouldn't be turned on. YCM will work only in filetypes that both the whitelist and the blacklist allow (the blacklist ""allows"" a filetype by _not_ having it as a key).  For example, let's assume you want YCM to work in files with the `cpp` filetype. The filetype should then be present in the whitelist either directly (`cpp` key in the whitelist) or indirectly through the special `*` key. It should _not_ be present in the blacklist.  Filetypes that are blocked by the either of the lists will be completely ignored by YCM, meaning that neither the identifier-based completion engine nor the semantic engine will operate in them.  You can get the filetype of the current file in Vim with `:set ft?`.  Default: `{'*' : 1}`  ```viml let g:ycm_filetype_whitelist = { '*': 1 } ``` "
2329,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_filetype_blacklist` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," This option controls for which Vim filetypes (see `:h filetype`) should YCM be turned off. The option value should be a Vim dictionary with keys being filetype strings (like `python`, `cpp` etc) and values being unimportant (the dictionary is used like a hash set, meaning that only the keys matter).  See the `g:ycm_filetype_whitelist` option for more details on how this works.  Default: `[see next line]`  ```viml let g:ycm_filetype_blacklist = {       \ 'tagbar' : 1,       \ 'qf' : 1,       \ 'notes' : 1,       \ 'markdown' : 1,       \ 'unite' : 1,       \ 'text' : 1,       \ 'vimwiki' : 1,       \ 'pandoc' : 1,       \ 'infolog' : 1,       \ 'mail' : 1       \} ``` "
2330,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_filetype_specific_completion_to_disable` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," This option controls for which Vim filetypes (see `:h filetype`) should the YCM semantic completion engine be turned off. The option value should be a Vim dictionary with keys being filetype strings (like `python`, `cpp` etc) and values being unimportant (the dictionary is used like a hash set, meaning that only the keys matter). The listed filetypes will be ignored by the YCM semantic completion engine, but the identifier-based completion engine will still trigger in files of those filetypes.  Note that even if semantic completion is not turned off for a specific filetype, you will not get semantic completion if the semantic engine does not support that filetype.  You can get the filetype of the current file in Vim with `:set ft?`.  Default: `[see next line]`  ```viml let g:ycm_filetype_specific_completion_to_disable = {       \ 'gitcommit': 1       \} ``` "
2331,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_show_diagnostics_ui` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," When set, this option turns on YCM's diagnostic display features. See the _Diagnostic display_ section in the _User Manual_ for more details.  Specific parts of the diagnostics UI (like the gutter signs, text highlighting, diagnostic echo and auto location list population) can be individually turned on or off. See the other options below for details.  Note that YCM's diagnostics UI is only supported for C-family languages.  When set, this option also makes YCM remove all Syntastic checkers set for the `c`, `cpp`, `objc` and `objcpp` filetypes since this would conflict with YCM's own diagnostics UI.  If you're using YCM's identifier completer in C-family languages but cannot use the clang-based semantic completer for those languages _and_ want to use the GCC Syntastic checkers, unset this option.  Default: `1`  ```viml let g:ycm_show_diagnostics_ui = 1 ``` "
2332,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_error_symbol` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," YCM will use the value of this option as the symbol for errors in the Vim gutter.  This option is part of the Syntastic compatibility layer; if the option is not set, YCM will fall back to the value of the `g:syntastic_error_symbol` option before using this option's default.  Default: `>>`  ```viml let g:ycm_error_symbol = '>>' ``` "
2333,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_warning_symbol` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," YCM will use the value of this option as the symbol for warnings in the Vim gutter.

Default: `>>`  ```viml let g:ycm_warning_symbol = '>>' ``` "
2334,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_enable_diagnostic_signs` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," When this option is set, YCM will put icons in Vim's gutter on lines that have a diagnostic set. Turning this off will also turn off the `YcmErrorLine` and `YcmWarningLine` highlighting.  This option is part of the Syntastic compatibility layer; if the option is not set, YCM will fall back to the value of the `g:syntastic_enable_signs` option before using this option's default.  Default: `1`  ```viml let g:ycm_enable_diagnostic_signs = 1 ``` "
2335,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_enable_diagnostic_highlighting` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," When this option is set, YCM will highlight regions of text that are related to the diagnostic that is present on a line, if any.  This option is part of the Syntastic compatibility layer; if the option is not set, YCM will fall back to the value of the `g:syntastic_enable_highlighting` option before using this option's default.  Default: `1`  ```viml let g:ycm_enable_diagnostic_highlighting = 1 ``` "
2336,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_echo_current_diagnostic` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," When this option is set, YCM will echo the text of the diagnostic present on the current line when you move your cursor to that line. If a `FixIt` is available for the current diagnostic, then ` (FixIt)` is appended.  This option is part of the Syntastic compatibility layer; if the option is not set, YCM will fall back to the value of the `g:syntastic_echo_current_error` option before using this option's default.  Default: `1`  ```viml let g:ycm_echo_current_diagnostic = 1 ``` "
2337,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_always_populate_location_list` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," When this option is set, YCM will populate the location list automatically every time it gets new diagnostic data. This option is off by default so as not to interfere with other data you might have placed in the location list.  See `:help location-list` in Vim to learn more about the location list.  This option is part of the Syntastic compatibility layer; if the option is not set, YCM will fall back to the value of the `g:syntastic_always_populate_loc_list` option before using this option's default.  Default: `0`  ```viml let g:ycm_always_populate_location_list = 0 ``` "
2338,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_open_loclist_on_ycm_diags` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," When this option is set, `:YcmDiags` will automatically open the location list after forcing a compilation and filling the list with diagnostic data.  See `:help location-list` in Vim to learn more about the location list.  Default: `1`  ```viml let g:ycm_open_loclist_on_ycm_diags = 1 ``` "
2339,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_allow_changing_updatetime` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," When this option is set to `1`, YCM will change the `updatetime` Vim option to `2000` (see `:h updatetime`). This may conflict with some other plugins you have (but it's unlikely). The `updatetime` option is the number of milliseconds that have to pass before Vim's `CursorHold` (see `:h CursorHold`) event fires. YCM runs the completion engines' ""file comprehension"" systems in the background on every such event; the identifier-based engine collects the identifiers whereas the semantic engine compiles the file to build an AST.  The Vim default of `4000` for `updatetime` is a bit long, so YCM reduces this. Set this option to `0` to force YCM to leave your `updatetime` setting alone.  Default: `1`  ```viml let g:ycm_allow_changing_updatetime = 1 ``` "
2340,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_complete_in_comments` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," When this option is set to `1`, YCM will show the completion menu even when typing inside comments.  Default: `0`  ```viml let g:ycm_complete_in_comments = 0 ``` "
2341,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_complete_in_strings` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," When this option is set to `1`, YCM will show the completion menu even when typing inside strings.  Note that this is turned on by default so that you can use the filename completion inside strings. This is very useful for instance in C-family files where typing `#include ""` will trigger the start of filename completion. If you turn off this option, you will turn off filename completion in such situations as well.  Default: `1`  ```viml let g:ycm_complete_in_strings = 1 ``` "
2342,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_collect_identifiers_from_comments_and_strings` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," When this option is set to `1`, YCM's identifier completer will also collect identifiers from strings and comments. Otherwise, the text in comments and strings will be ignored.  Default: `0`  ```viml let g:ycm_collect_identifiers_from_comments_and_strings = 0 ``` "
2343,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_collect_identifiers_from_tags_files` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," When this option is set to `1`, YCM's identifier completer will also collect identifiers from tags files. The list of tags files to examine is retrieved from the `tagfiles()` Vim function which examines the `tags` Vim option. See `:h 'tags'` for details.  YCM will re-index your tags files if it detects that they have been modified.  The only supported tag format is the [Exuberant Ctags format][ctags-format]. The format from ""plain"" ctags is NOT supported. Ctags needs to be called with the `--fields=+l` option (that's a lowercase `L`, not a one) because YCM needs the `language:<lang>` field in the tags output.  See the _FAQ_ for pointers if YCM does not appear to read your tag files.  This option is off by default because it makes Vim slower if your tags are on a network directory.  Default: `0`  ```viml let g:ycm_collect_identifiers_from_tags_files = 0 ``` "
2344,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_seed_identifiers_with_syntax` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," When this option is set to `1`, YCM's identifier completer will seed its identifier database with the keywords of the programming language you're writing.  Since the keywords are extracted from the Vim syntax file for the filetype, all keywords may not be collected, depending on how the syntax file was written. Usually at least 95% of the keywords are successfully extracted.  Default: `0`  ```viml let g:ycm_seed_identifiers_with_syntax = 0 ``` "
2345,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_extra_conf_vim_data` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," If you're using semantic completion for C-family files, this option might come handy; it's a way of sending data from Vim to your `FlagsForFile` function in your `.ycm_extra_conf.py` file.  This option is supposed to be a list of VimScript expression strings that are evaluated for every request to the [ycmd server][ycmd] and then passed to your `FlagsForFile` function as a `client_data` keyword argument.  For instance, if you set this option to `['v:version']`, your `FlagsForFile` function will be called like this:  ```python"
2346,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,# The '704' value is of course contingent on Vim 7.4; in 7.3 it would be '703',3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,1,"FlagsForFile(filename, client_data = {'v:version': 704}) ```  So the `client_data` parameter is a dictionary mapping Vim expression strings to their values at the time of the request.  The correct way to define parameters for your `FlagsForFile` function:  ```python def FlagsForFile(filename, **kwargs): ```  You can then get to `client_data` with `kwargs['client_data']`.  Default: `[]`  ```viml let g:ycm_extra_conf_vim_data = [] ``` "
2347,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_server_python_interpreter` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3, YCM will by default search for an appropriate Python interpreter on your system. You can use this option to override that behavior and force the use of a specific interpreter of your choosing.  NOTE: This interpreter is only used for the [ycmd server][ycmd]. The YCM client running inside Vim always uses the Python interpreter that's embedded inside Vim.  Default: `''`  ```viml let g:ycm_server_python_interpreter = '' ``` 
2348,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_server_keep_logfiles` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," When this option is set to `1`, the [ycmd completion server][ycmd] will keep the logfiles around after shutting down (they are deleted on shutdown by default).  To see where the logfiles are, call `:YcmDebugInfo`.  Default: `0`  ```viml let g:ycm_server_keep_logfiles = 0 ``` "

2353,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_csharp_insert_namespace_expr` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," By default, when YCM inserts a namespace, it will insert the `using` statement under the nearest `using` statement. You may prefer that the `using` statement is inserted somewhere, for example, to preserve sorting. If so, you can set this option to override this behavior.  When this option is set, instead of inserting the `using` statement itself, YCM will set the global variable `g:ycm_namespace_to_insert` to the namespace to insert, and then evaluate this option's value as an expression. The option's expression is responsible for inserting the namespace - the default insertion will not occur.  Default: ''  ```viml let g:ycm_csharp_insert_namespace_expr = '' ``` "
2354,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_add_preview_to_completeopt` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," When this option is set to `1`, YCM will add the `preview` string to Vim's `completeopt` option (see `:h completeopt`). If your `completeopt` option already has `preview` set, there will be no effect. You can see the current state of your `completeopt` setting with `:set completeopt?` (yes, the question mark is important).  When `preview` is present in `completeopt`, YCM will use the `preview` window at the top of the file to store detailed information about the current completion candidate (but only if the candidate came from the semantic engine). For instance, it would show the full function prototype and all the function overloads in the window if the current completion is a function name.  Default: `0`  ```viml let g:ycm_add_preview_to_completeopt = 0 ``` "
2355,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_autoclose_preview_window_after_completion` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," When this option is set to `1`, YCM will auto-close the `preview` window after the user accepts the offered completion string. If there is no `preview` window triggered because there is no `preview` string in `completeopt`, this option is irrelevant. See the `g:ycm_add_preview_to_completeopt` option for more details.  Default: `0`  ```viml let g:ycm_autoclose_preview_window_after_completion = 0 ``` "
2356,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_autoclose_preview_window_after_insertion` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," When this option is set to `1`, YCM will auto-close the `preview` window after the user leaves insert mode. This option is irrelevant if `g:ycm_autoclose_preview_window_after_completion` is set or if no `preview` window is triggered. See the `g:ycm_add_preview_to_completeopt` option for more details.

Invoking any of them repeatedly cycles forward through the completion list.  Some users like adding `<Enter>` to this list.  Default: `['<TAB>', '<Down>']`  ```viml let g:ycm_key_list_select_completion = ['<TAB>', '<Down>'] ``` "
2359,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_key_list_previous_completion` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," This option controls the key mappings used to select the previous completion string. Invoking any of them repeatedly cycles backwards through the completion list.  Note that one of the defaults is `<S-TAB>` which means Shift-TAB. That mapping will probably only work in GUI Vim (Gvim or MacVim) and not in plain console Vim because the terminal usually does not forward modifier key combinations to Vim.  Default: `['<S-TAB>', '<Up>']`  ```viml let g:ycm_key_list_previous_completion = ['<S-TAB>', '<Up>'] ``` "
2360,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_key_invoke_completion` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," This option controls the key mapping used to invoke the completion menu for semantic completion. By default, semantic completion is trigged automatically after typing `.`, `->` and `::` in insert mode (if semantic completion support has been compiled in). This key mapping can be used to trigger semantic completion anywhere. Useful for searching for top-level functions and classes.  Console Vim (not Gvim or MacVim) passes `<Nul>` to Vim when the user types `<C-Space>` so YCM will make sure that `<Nul>` is used in the map command when you're editing in console Vim, and `<C-Space>` in GUI Vim. This means that you can just press `<C-Space>` in both console and GUI Vim and YCM will do the right thing.  Setting this option to an empty string will make sure no mapping is created.  Default: `<C-Space>`  ```viml let g:ycm_key_invoke_completion = '<C-Space>' ``` "
2361,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_key_detailed_diagnostics` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3, This option controls the key mapping used to show the full diagnostic text when the user's cursor is on the line with the diagnostic. It basically calls `:YcmShowDetailedDiagnostic`.  Setting this option to an empty string will make sure no mapping is created.  Default: `<leader>d`  ```viml let g:ycm_key_detailed_diagnostics = '<leader>d' ``` 
2362,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_global_ycm_extra_conf` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," Normally, YCM searches for a `.ycm_extra_conf.py` file for compilation flags (see the User Guide for more details on how this works). This option specifies a fallback path to a config file which is used if no `.ycm_extra_conf.py` is found.  You can place such a global file anywhere in your filesystem.  Default: `''`  ```viml let g:ycm_global_ycm_extra_conf = '' ``` "
2363,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_confirm_extra_conf` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," When this option is set to `1` YCM will ask once per `.ycm_extra_conf.py` file if it is safe to be loaded. This is to prevent execution of malicious code from a `.ycm_extra_conf.py` file you didn't write.  To selectively get YCM to ask/not ask about loading certain `.ycm_extra_conf.py` files, see the `g:ycm_extra_conf_globlist` option.  Default: `1`  ```viml let g:ycm_confirm_extra_conf = 1 ``` "
2364,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_extra_conf_globlist` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," This option is a list that may contain several globbing patterns. If a pattern starts with a `!` all `.ycm_extra_conf.py` files matching that pattern will be blacklisted, that is they won't be loaded and no confirmation dialog will be shown. If a pattern does not start with a `!` all files matching that pattern will be whitelisted. Note that this option is not used when confirmation is disabled using `g:ycm_confirm_extra_conf` and that items earlier in the list will take precedence over the later ones.  Rules:  * `*`       matches everything * `?`       matches any single character * `[seq]`   matches any character in seq * `[!seq]`  matches any char not in seq  Example:  ```viml let g:ycm_extra_conf_globlist = ['~/dev/*','!~/*'] ```  * The first rule will match everything contained in the `~/dev` directory so   `.ycm_extra_conf.py` files from there will be loaded. * The second rule will match everything in the home directory so a   `.ycm_extra_conf.py` file from there won't be loaded. * As the first rule takes precedence everything in the home directory excluding   the `~/dev` directory will be blacklisted.  NOTE: The glob pattern is first expanded with Python's `os.path.expanduser()` and then resolved with `os.path.abspath()` before being matched against the filename.  Default: `[]`  ```viml let g:ycm_extra_conf_globlist = [] ``` "
2365,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_filepath_completion_use_working_dir` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," By default, YCM's filepath completion will interpret relative paths like `../` as being relative to the folder of the file of the currently active buffer. Setting this option will force YCM to always interpret relative paths as being relative to Vim's current working directory.  Default: `0`  ```viml let g:ycm_filepath_completion_use_working_dir = 0 ``` "
2366,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_semantic_triggers` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," This option controls the character-based triggers for the various semantic completion engines. The option holds a dictionary of key-values, where the keys are Vim's filetype strings delimited by commas and values are lists of strings, where the strings are the triggers.  Setting key-value pairs on the dictionary _adds_ semantic triggers to the internal default set (listed below). You cannot remove the default triggers, only add new ones.  A ""trigger"" is a sequence of one or more characters that trigger semantic completion when typed. For instance, C++ (`cpp` filetype) has `.` listed as a trigger. So when the user types `foo.`, the semantic engine will trigger and serve `foo`'s list of member functions and variables. Since C++ also has `->` listed as a trigger, the same thing would happen when the user typed `foo->`.  It's also possible to use a regular expression as a trigger. You have to prefix your trigger with `re!` to signify it's a regex trigger. For instance, `re!\w+\.` would only trigger after the `\w+\.` regex matches.  NOTE: The regex syntax is **NOT** Vim's, it's [Python's][python-re].  Default: `[see next line]`  ```viml let g:ycm_semantic_triggers =  {   \   'c' : ['->', '.'],   \   'objc' : ['->', '.', 're!\[[_a-zA-Z]+\w*\s', 're!^\s*[^\W\d]\w*\s',   \             're!\[.*\]\s'],   \   'ocaml' : ['.', '#'],   \   'cpp,objcpp' : ['->', '.', '::'],   \   'perl' : ['->'],   \   'php' : ['->', '::'],   \   'cs,java,javascript,typescript,d,python,perl6,scala,vb,elixir,go' : ['.'],   \   'ruby' : ['.', '::'],   \   'lua' : ['.', ':'],   \   'erlang' : [':'],   \ } ``` "
2367,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_cache_omnifunc` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," Some omnicompletion engines do not work well with the YCM cache—in particular, they might not produce all possible results for a given prefix. By unsetting this option you can ensure that the omnicompletion engine is re-queried on every keypress. That will ensure all completions will be presented, but might cause stuttering and lagginess if the omnifunc is slow.  Default: `1`  ```viml let g:ycm_cache_omnifunc = 1 ``` "
2368,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### The `g:ycm_use_ultisnips_completer` option,3,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," By default, YCM will query the UltiSnips plugin for possible completions of snippet triggers. This option can turn that behavior off.  Default: `1`  ```viml let g:ycm_use_ultisnips_completer = 1 ``` "

2373,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,"### I used to be able to `import vim` in `.ycm_extra_conf.py`, but now can't",6,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," YCM was rewritten to use a client-server architecture where most of the logic is in the [ycmd server][ycmd]. So the magic `vim` module you could have previously imported in your `.ycm_extra_conf.py` files doesn't exist anymore.  To be fair, importing the magic `vim` module in extra conf files was never supported in the first place; it only ever worked by accident and was never a part of the extra conf API.  But fear not, you should be able to tweak your extra conf files to continue working by using the `g:ycm_extra_conf_vim_data` option. See the docs on that option for details. "
2374,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### On very rare occasions Vim crashes when I tab through the completion menu,6,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3, That's a very rare Vim bug most users never encounter. It's fixed in Vim 7.4.72. Update to that version (or above) to resolve the issue. 
2375,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### I get `ImportError` exceptions that mention `PyInit_ycm_core` or `initycm_core`,6,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," These errors are caused by building the YCM native libraries for Python 2 and trying to load them into a Python 3 process (or the other way around).  For instance, if building for Python 2 but loading in Python 3:  ``` ImportError: dynamic module does not define init function (PyInit_ycm_core) ```  If building for Python 3 but loading in Python 2:  ``` ImportError: dynamic module does not define init function (initycm_core) ```  Setting the `g:ycm_server_python_interpreter` option to force the use of a specific Python interpreter for `ycmd` is usually the easiest way to solve the problem. Common values for that option are `/usr/bin/python` and `/usr/bin/python3`. "
2376,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### I get a linker warning regarding `libpython` on Mac when compiling YCM,6,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," If the warning is `ld: warning: path '/usr/lib/libpython2.7.dylib' following -L not a directory`, then feel free to ignore it; it's caused by a limitation of CMake and is not an issue. Everything should still work fine. "
2377,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### I get a weird window at the top of my file when I use the semantic engine,6,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," This is Vim's `preview` window. Vim uses it to show you extra information about something if such information is available. YCM provides Vim with such extra information. For instance, when you select a function in the completion list, the `preview` window will hold that function's prototype and the prototypes of any overloads of the function. It will stay there after you select the completion so that you can use the information about the parameters and their types to write the function call.  If you would like this window to auto-close after you select a completion string, set the `g:ycm_autoclose_preview_window_after_completion` option to `1` in your `vimrc` file. Similarly, the `g:ycm_autoclose_preview_window_after_insertion` option can be set to close the `preview` window after leaving insert mode.  If you don't want this window to ever show up, add `set completeopt-=preview` to your `vimrc`. Also make sure that the `g:ycm_add_preview_to_completeopt` option is set to `0`. "
2378,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### It appears that YCM is not working,6,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," In Vim, run `:messages` and carefully read the output. YCM will echo messages to the message log if it encounters problems. It's likely you misconfigured something and YCM is complaining about it.  Also, you may want to run the `:YcmDebugInfo` command; it will make YCM spew out various debugging information, including the [ycmd][] logfile paths and the compile flags for the current file if the file is a C-family language file and you have compiled in Clang support. Logfiles can be automatically opened in the editor using the `:YcmToggleLogs` command. "
2379,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### Sometimes it takes much longer to get semantic completions than normal,6,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," This means that libclang (which YCM uses for C-family semantic completion) failed to pre-compile your file's preamble. In other words, there was an error compiling some of the source code you pulled in through your header files. I suggest calling the `:YcmDiags` command to see what they were.  Bottom line, if libclang can't pre-compile your file's preamble because there were errors in it, you're going to get slow completions because there's no AST cache. "
2380,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### YCM auto-inserts completion strings I don't want!,6,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," This means you probably have some mappings that interfere with YCM's internal ones. Make sure you don't have something mapped to `<C-p>`, `<C-x>` or `<C-u>` (in insert mode).  YCM _never_ selects something for you; it just shows you a menu and the user has to explicitly select something. If something is being selected automatically, this means there's a bug or a misconfiguration somewhere. "
2381,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### I get a `E227: mapping already exists for <blah>` error when I start Vim,6,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3, This means that YCM tried to set up a key mapping but failed because you already had something mapped to that key combination. The `<blah>` part of the message will tell you what was the key combination that failed.  Look in the _Options_ section and see if any of the default mappings conflict with your own. Then change that option value to something else so that the conflict goes away. 
2382,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### I get `'GLIBC_2.XX' not found (required by libclang.so)` when starting Vim,6,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3, Your system is too old for the precompiled binaries from llvm.org. Compile Clang on your machine and then link against the `libclang.so` you just produced. See the full installation guide for help. 
2383,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### I'm trying to use a Homebrew Vim with YCM and I'm getting segfaults,6,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," Something (I don't know what) is wrong with the way that Homebrew configures and builds Vim. I recommend using [MacVim][]. Even if you don't like the MacVim GUI, you can use the Vim binary that is inside the MacVim.app package (it's `MacVim.app/Contents/MacOS/Vim`) and get the Vim console experience. "
2384,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### I have a Homebrew Python and/or MacVim; can't compile/SIGABRT when starting,6,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," You should probably run `brew rm python; brew install python` to get the latest fixes that should make YCM work with such a configuration. Also rebuild Macvim then. If you still get problems with this, see [issue #18][issue18] for suggestions. "
2385,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### Vim segfaults when I use the semantic completer in Ruby files,6,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," This was caused by a Vim bug. Update your version of Vim (Vim 7.3.874 is known to work, earlier versions may also fix this issue). "
2386,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### I get `LONG_BIT definition appears wrong for platform` when compiling,6,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," Look at the output of your CMake call. There should be a line in it like the following (with `.dylib` in place of `.so` on a Mac):  ``` -- Found PythonLibs: /usr/lib/libpython2.7.so (Required is at least version ""2.5"") ```  That would be the **correct** output. An example of **incorrect** output would be the following:  ``` -- Found PythonLibs: /usr/lib/libpython2.7.so (found suitable version ""2.5.1"", minimum required is ""2.5"") ```  Notice how there's an extra bit of output there, the `found suitable version ""<version>""` part, where `<version>` is not the same as the version of the dynamic library. In the example shown, the library is version 2.7 but the second string is version `2.5.1`.  This means that CMake found one version of Python headers and a different version for the library. This is wrong. It can happen when you have multiple versions of Python installed on your machine.  You should probably add the following flags to your cmake call (again, `dylib` instead of `so` on a Mac):  ``` -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/python2.7 -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/libpython2.7.so ```  This will force the paths to the Python include directory and the Python library to use. You may need to set these flags to something else, but you need to make sure you use the same version of Python that your Vim binary is built against, which is highly likely to be the system's default Python. "
2387,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### I get `libpython2.7.a [...] relocation R_X86_64_32` when compiling,6,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," The error is usually encountered when compiling YCM on Centos or RHEL. The full error looks something like the following:  ``` /usr/bin/ld: /usr/local/lib/libpython2.7.a(abstract.o): relocation R_X86_64_32 against `a local symbol' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC ```  It's possible to get a slightly different error that's similar to the one above. Here's the problem and how you solve it:  Your `libpython2.7.a` was not compiled with `-fPIC` so it can't be linked into `ycm_core.so`.  Use the `-DPYTHON_LIBRARY=` CMake flag to point it to a `.so` version of libpython on your machine (for instance, `-DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/libpython2.7.so`). Naturally, this means you'll have to go through the full installation guide by hand. "
2388,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### I get `Vim: Caught deadly signal SEGV` on Vim startup,6,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," This can happen on some Linux distros. If you encounter this situation, run Vim under `gdb`. You'll probably see something like this in the output when Vim crashes:  ``` undefined symbol: clang_CompileCommands_dispose ```  This means that Vim is trying to load a `libclang.so` that is too old. You need at least a 3.2 libclang. Some distros ship with a system `libclang.so` that identifies itself as 3.2 but is not; it was cut from the upstream sources before the official 3.2 release and some API changes (like the addition of the CompileCommands API) were added after their cut.  So just go through the installation guide and make sure you are using a correct `libclang.so`. I recommend downloading prebuilt binaries from llvm.org.  "
2389,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### I get `Fatal Python error: PyThreadState_Get: no current thread` on startup,6,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," This is caused by linking a static version of `libpython` into ycmd's `ycm_core.so`.  This leads to multiple copies of the python interpreter loaded when `python` loads `ycmd_core.so` and this messes up python's global state. The details aren't important.  The solution is that the version of Python linked and run against must be built with either `--enable-shared` or `--enable-framework` (on OS X). This is achieved as follows (NOTE: for Mac, replace `--enable-shared` with `--enable-framework`):  - When building python from source: `./configure --enable-shared {options}` - When building python from pyenv:   `PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS=""--enable-shared"" pyenv install {version}`  "

2391,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### YCM does not read identifiers from my tags files,6,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," First, put `let g:ycm_collect_identifiers_from_tags_files = 1` in your vimrc.  Make sure you are using [Exuberant Ctags][exuberant-ctags] to produce your tags files since the only supported tag format is the [Exuberant Ctags format][ctags-format]. The format from ""plain"" ctags is NOT supported. The output of `ctags --version` should list ""Exuberant Ctags"".  Ctags needs to be called with the `--fields=+l` (that's a lowercase `L`, not a one) option because YCM needs the `language:<lang>` field in the tags output.  NOTE: [Exuberant Ctags][exuberant-ctags] by default sets language tag for `*.h` files as `C++`. If you have C (not C++) project, consider giving parameter `--langmap=c:.c.h` to ctags to see tags from `*.h` files.  NOTE: Mac OS X comes with ""plain"" ctags installed by default. `brew install ctags` will get you the Exuberant Ctags version.  Also make sure that your Vim `tags` option is set correctly. See `:h 'tags'` for details. If you want to see which tag files YCM will read for a given buffer, run `:echo tagfiles()` with the relevant buffer active. Note that that function will only list tag files that already exist. "

2394,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,"### Why isn't YCM just written in plain VimScript, FFS?",6,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," Because of the identifier completion engine and subsequence-based filtering. Let's say you have _many_ dozens of files open in a single Vim instance (I often do); the identifier-based engine then needs to store thousands (if not tens of thousands) of identifiers in its internal data-structures. When the user types, YCM needs to perform subsequence-based filtering on _all_ of those identifiers (every single one!) in less than 10 milliseconds.  I'm sorry, but that level of performance is just plain impossible to achieve with VimScript. I've tried, and the language is just too slow. No, you can't get acceptable performance even if you limit yourself to just the identifiers in the current file and simple prefix-based filtering. "
2395,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### Why does YCM demand such a recent version of Vim?,6,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," During YCM's development several show-stopper bugs were encountered in Vim. Those needed to be fixed upstream (and were). A few months after those bugs were fixed, Vim trunk landed the `pyeval()` function which improved YCM performance even more since less time was spent serializing and deserializing data between Vim and the embedded Python interpreter. A few critical bugfixes for `pyeval()` landed in Vim 7.3.584 (and a few commits before that). "

Using `Ctrl-C` to exit insert mode in Vim is a bad idea. The main issue here is that `Ctrl-C` in Vim doesn't just leave insert mode, it leaves it without triggering `InsertLeave` autocommands (as per Vim docs). This is a bad idea and is likely to break many other things and not just YCM.  Bottom line, if you use `Ctrl-C` to exit insert mode in Vim, you're gonna have a bad time.  If pressing `<esc>` is too annoying (agreed, it is), we suggest mapping it to something more convenient. On a QWERTY keyboard, a good pick for the `<esc>` map is `inoremap jk <Esc>`. This is right on the home row, it's an incredibly rare digraph in English and if you ever need to type those two chars in sequence in insert mode, you just type `j`, then wait 500ms, then type `k`. "
2401,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### Why did YCM stop using Syntastic for diagnostics display?,6,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," Previously, YCM would send any diagnostics it would receive from the libclang semantic engine to Syntastic for display as signs in the gutter, red squiggles etc. Today, YCM uses its own code to do that.  Using Syntastic for this was always a kludge. Syntastic assumes its ""checker"" plugins behave in a certain way; those assumptions have never fit YCM. For instance, YCM continuously recompiles your code in the background for C-family languages and tries to push new diagnostics to the user as fast as possible, even while the user types.  Syntastic assumes that a checker only runs on file save (""active"" mode) or even less frequently, when the user explicitly invokes it (""passive"" mode). This mismatch in assumptions causes performance problems since Syntastic code isn't optimized for this use case of constant diagnostic refreshing.  Poor support for this use case also led to crash bugs in Vim caused by Syntastic-Vim interactions ([issue #593][issue-593]) and other problems, like random Vim flickering. Attempts were made to resolve these issues in Syntastic, but ultimately some of them failed (for various reasons).  Implementing diagnostic display code directly in YCM resolves all of these problems. Performance also improved substantially since the relevant code is now written in Python instead of VimScript (which is very slow) and is tailored only for YCM's use-cases. We were also able to introduce new features in this area since we're now not limited to the Syntastic checker API.  We've tried to implement this in the most backwards-compatible way possible; YCM options that control diagnostic display fall back to Syntastic options that control the same concepts if the user has those set.  Still, some Syntastic-specific configuration you might have had might not be supported by the new code. Please file issues on the tracker in such cases; if we find the request to be reasonable, we'll find a way to address it. "
2402,201,https://github.com/memorywarning/YouCompleteMe,### Completion doesn't work with the C++ standard library headers,6,memorywarning.YouCompleteMe.md,3," This is caused by an issue with libclang that only affects some operating systems. Compiling with `clang` the binary will use the correct default header search paths but compiling with `libclang.so` (which YCM uses) does not.  Mac OS X is normally affected, but there's a workaround in YCM for that specific OS. If you're not running that OS but still have the same problem, continue reading.  The workaround is to call `echo | clang -v -E -x c++ -` and look at the paths under the `#include <...> search starts here:` heading. You should take those paths, prepend `-isystem` to each individual path and append them all to the list of flags you return from your `FlagsForFile` function in your `.ycm_extra_conf.py` file.  See [issue #303][issue-303] for details. "

2468,203,https://github.com/fp7-netide/Engine,# The NetIDE Network Engine,126,fp7-netide.Engine.md,1,"The **Network Engine** provides to unmodified SDN applications (called Modules in the Figure below) the runtime they expect. Additionally it implements a composition mechanism to create new applications from previously implemented modules and to make them cooperating with modules running on top of the operator’s controller (represented by the Server Controller in the Figure), effectively building a single Network Application.  The Network Engine follows the layered SDN controller approach proposed by the Open Networking Foundation. It comprises a client controller layer that executes the modules network applications are composed of and a server SDN controller layer that drives the underlying infrastructure.  The challenge is to integrate client and server controllers. To maximize reuse, we use separate adaptors for the Southbound Interface (SBI), called Backend, and for the Northbound Interface (NBI), called Shim. This separation imposes a protocol between them, the NetIDE Intermediate Protocol (see the full protocol specification in libraries/netip/docs). In our first implementations [1] we have proved that the Shim/Backend structure connected by an intermediate protocol is feasible and sensible. However, they still left the fundamental component in these modules: the composition logic. This implied that it needed to be reimplemented for each controller framework we wanted to support. To overcome this shortcoming, we introduce an intermediate layer, the Core: it hosts all logic and data structures that are independent of the particular controller frameworks and communicates with both Shim and Backend using the same NetIDE Intermediate Protocol. The Core makes both Shim and Backend light-weight and easier to implement for new controllers.  This repository contains source code and documentation of the Core, Shim (implemented for OpenDaylight, ONOS and Ryu) and Backend (implemented for Ryu and Floodlight), plus some utilities for testing the Network Engine.

Well, it's nearly as easy to iterate over an object in the same way. (Remember, arrays are essentially fancy objects — it makes sense that iteration would be similar.)  But objects don't have sequential indexes like arrays do, so we need another way of getting the keys. Luckily, that's exactly what `Object.keys()` is for!  ``` javascript var meals = {   breakfast: 'oatmeal',   lunch: 'tuna',   dinner: 'spaghetti' }  var mealNames = Object.keys(meals)  for (var i = 0, l = mealNames.length; i < l; i++) {   console.log(`I ate ${meals[mealNames[i]]} for ${mealNames[i]}!`) }  // I ate oatmeal for breakfast! // I ate tuna for lunch! // I ate spaghetti for dinner! ```  But this is a little verbose and sort of hard to read: we have to get the name of the meal using `mealNames[i]` and then use that name as a key in the object `meals` to get the food for that meal (`meals[mealNames[i]]`). Gross.  There's a (slightly) better way! JavaScript has a special loop, called `for...in`, that makes iterating over objects a bit easier:  ``` javascript var meals = {   breakfast: 'oatmeal',   lunch: 'tuna',   dinner: 'spaghetti' }  for (var mealName in meals) {   console.log(`I ate ${meals[mealName]} for ${mealName}!`) } ```  Much better.  **NOTE**: You can use `for...in` loops with arrays, too, but the variable that you get will just be the index (in order), so this particular loop is _usually_ used with objects.

It is written with js, html5, and webGL. It depends on the open source libraries as noted in the [3rd Party Libraries](https://github.com/hawksley/eleVR-Picture-Player/blob/master/README.md#3rd-party-libraries) section.  eleVR Picture Player works with the native browser support currently being implemented by [Firefox](http://blog.bitops.com/blog/2014/06/26/first-steps-for-vr-on-the-web/) and [Chromium](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BzudLt22BqGRbW9WTHMtOWMzNjQ&usp=sharing#list).  The player is a fun fork of the [eleVR Web Player for web video](https://github.com/hawksley/eleVR-Web-Player) with some changes to optimize the player for showing panoramic pictures.  Pictures shown in the player can be rotated using keyboard controls  (a/d, w/s, and q/e), as well as by the Oculus Rift if you are running an experimental webVR browser. You may be able to decrease video judder by setting your Oculus Display refresh rate to 60 Hz (the browser refreshes at 60 Hz and the slower mismatch can cause judder). "

If your video is equirectangular 2D, preface your picture by 0. If it is stereo top/bottom, preface it by 1.

If you want to add your picture to the drop-down, create a new option in the html picture-select element that looks like: <option value=""myPicture.jpg"">My Pic</option>  If you want your picture to be the picture loaded initially, change the source of the picture in the html img tag with the id ""pano-image"".

[Here](https://github.com/nus-cs2103/website/pull/78)       is an example.    3. Check the diff view of the PR to ensure it contains the intended changes only. 8. Your code will be reviewed by someone from the dev team. If the reviewer requests changes,    revise the code, push the new commits to your branch, and post a comment to say the pull request    is ready for review again. 9. When your code is acceptable, it will be merged to this repo. Your fix will be included in the    next release of the website. 10.

We can update our app and our tests in real-time, keeping a weather eye on the console for broken tests. Karma is occasionally confused and it is often necessary to shut down its browser or even shut the command down (`Ctrl-C`) and restart it. No worries; it's pretty quick. "

Their filenames must end in `.e2e-spec.ts`.  Look for the example `e2e/app.e2e-spec.ts`. Add more `.e2e-spec.js` files as you wish (although one usually suffices for small projects); we configured Protractor to find them.  Thereafter, run them with `npm run e2e`.  That command first compiles, then simultaneously starts the `lite-server` at `localhost:8080` and launches Protractor.  The pass/fail test results appear at the bottom of the terminal window. A custom reporter (see `protractor.config.js`) generates a  `./_test-output/protractor-results.txt` file which is easier to read; this file is excluded from source control.  Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.  [travis-badge]: https://travis-ci.org/angular/quickstart.svg?branch=master [travis-badge-url]: https://travis-ci.org/angular/quickstart"

2642,224,https://github.com/kylezhang/vsc,### 如何添加git地址？,-,kylezhang.vsc.md,3, vsc其实不管你的git初始化的，只要你当前是git管理的，它的git部分才有用。  也就是说git需要自己处理。  比如  ``` express helloworld cd helloworld git init git remote add origin git@github.com:ashtuchkin/iconv-lite.git git add . git commit -am 'init' ```  如果要切换分支，可以用checkout命令  ``` git checkout -b dev ```  如果是已有分支就  ``` git checkout dev ``` 
2643,224,https://github.com/kylezhang/vsc,### 怎么让语法检查器支持es6的语法呢？,-,kylezhang.vsc.md,3,"  要支持es6的话，需要在项目下建一个jsconfig.json，内容为  ``` {     ""compilerOptions"":{         ""target"":""ES6"",         ""module"":""commonjs""     } } ```  嫌麻烦的话可以安装下@hellopao 写的模块[jsf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsf)，通过命令行来生成该文件  ``` npm install jsf -g jsf ``` "

2664,227,https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-release,### Proxy,1,cloudfoundry.cf-mysql-release.md,3," Traffic to the MySQL cluster is routed through one or more proxy nodes. The current proxy implementation is [Switchboard](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/switchboard). This proxy acts as an intermediary between the client and the MySQL server, providing failover between MySQL nodes. The number of nodes is configured by the proxy job instance count in the deployment manifest.  **NOTE:** If the number of proxy nodes is set to zero, apps will be bound to the IP address of the first MySQL node in the cluster. If that IP address should change for any reason (e.g. loss of a VM) or a proxy was subsequently added, one would need to re-bind all apps to the IP address of the new node.  For more details see the [proxy documentation](/docs/proxy.md).  <a name=""dashboard""></a>"
2665,227,https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-release,### Dashboard,1,cloudfoundry.cf-mysql-release.md,3, A user-facing service dashboard is provided by the service broker that displays storage utilization information for each service instance. The dashboard is accessible by users via Single Sign-On (SSO) once authenticated with Cloud Foundry. The dashboard URL can be found by running `cf service MY_SERVICE_INSTANCE`.  Service authors interested in implementing a service dashboard accessible via SSO can follow documentation for [Dashboard SSO](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/dashboard-sso.html). 
2666,227,https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-release,#### Prerequisites,3,cloudfoundry.cf-mysql-release.md,4," 1. SSO is initiated when a user navigates to the URL found in the `dashboard_url` field. This value is returned to cloud controller by the broker in response to a provision request, and is exposed in the cloud controller API for the service instance. A users client must expose this field as a link, or it can be obtained via curl (`cf curl /v2/service_instances/:guid`) and copied into a browser.  1. SSO requires the following OAuth client to be configured in cf-release. This client is responsible for creating the OAuth client for the MySQL dashboard. Without this client configured in cf-release, the MySQL dashboard will not be accessible but the service will be otherwise functional. Registering the broker will display a warning to this effect.      ```yaml     properties:       uaa:         clients:           cc-service-dashboards:             secret: cc-broker-secret             scope: cloud_controller.write,openid,cloud_controller.read,cloud_controller_service_permissions.read             authorities: clients.read,clients.write,clients.admin             authorized-grant-types: client_credentials     ```  1. SSO was implemented in v169 of cf-release; if you are on an older version of cf-release you'll encounter an error when you register the service broker. If upgrading cf-release is not an option, try removing the following lines from the cf-mysql-release manifest and redeploy.      ```yaml     dashboard_client:       id: p-mysql       secret: yoursecret     ``` "
2667,227,https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-release,#### Implementation Notes,3,cloudfoundry.cf-mysql-release.md,4," The following links show how this release implements [Dashboard SSO](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/dashboard-sso.html) integration.  1. Update the broker catalog with the dashboard client [properties](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-broker/blob/master/config/settings.yml#L26) 2. Implement oauth [workflow](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-broker/blob/master/config/initializers/omniauth.rb) with the [omniauth-uaa-oauth2 gem](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/omniauth-uaa-oauth2) 3. [Use](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-broker/blob/master/lib/uaa_session.rb) the [cf-uaa-lib gem](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-uaa-lib) to get a valid access token and request permissions on the instance 4. Before showing the user the dashboard, [the broker checks](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-broker/blob/master/app/controllers/manage/instances_controller.rb#L7) to see if the user is logged-in and has permissions to view the usage details of the instance. "
2668,227,https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-release,### Broker Configuration,3,cloudfoundry.cf-mysql-release.md,3,
2669,227,https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-release,#### Require HTTPS when visiting Dashboard,3,cloudfoundry.cf-mysql-release.md,4," The dashboard URL defaults to using the `https` scheme. This means any requests using `http` will automatically be redirected to `https` instead. To override this, you can change `jobs.cf-mysql-broker.ssl_enabled` to `false`.  Keep in mind that changing the `ssl_enabled` setting for an existing broker will not update previously advertised dashboard URLs.

2675,228,https://github.com/D630/bds,##### Llist,1,D630.bds.md,5,"Every script uses a trap on RETURN.   The double linked list gets a controlling associative array variable with the keys `lname[type]`, `lname[nodes]` and `lname[id]` as well as a second index array variable `lname_idx`, which indexes all nodes in the right order. Any node of the list will get its own associative array variable with the following keys: `lname_$((lname[id] + 1))=([prev]= [next]= [data]=)`. Of course, `lname_idx` isn't necessary. But iterating over the list is still slower.  ``` set         lname [element ...] unset       lname  insert      lname index [element ...] append      lname [element ...] replace     lname first last [element ...]  index       lname [index] range       lname [-r] first last  length      lname [-t]  traverse    lname [-r] index ``` "

2715,234,https://github.com/Apentz49/django-movies-api,### Normal Mode,13,Apentz49.django-movies-api.md,3, Included is a basic app where template driven views allow a user to create/read/delete new and existing movies in the database.  Create an app called `api` that all API requests will use and correctly perform the `verb` you are expecting.  Required verbs to implement:  - GET  - POST  - PUT  - DELETE  Required functionality to implment:  - Query for all movies  - Query for a specific movie  - Create a new movie in the database  - Update existing fields on an existing movie  - Delete an existing movie  How you choose to implement your API is up to you. The one hard requirement is that you do not rely on an external API framework. Choices like class-based or function-based views are up to you. In fact for clarity you may find function based views more of an optimal choice for this assignment. 
2716,234,https://github.com/Apentz49/django-movies-api,### Hard Mode,3,Apentz49.django-movies-api.md,3, In addition to the `normal mode` requirements adapt your movie model to be able to load in your movielens dataset (use a small dataset if you prefer) and adapt your views to be able to work with the new fields.

This is outside the scope of the cookbook because it's possible that you'll run the cookbook as your own user, not root and you'd have to be root to take ownership of the directory. Easiest way to get started:  ```bash sudo chown -R `whoami`:staff /usr/local ```  Bear in mind that this will take ownership of the entire folder and its contents, so if you've already got stuff in there (eg MySQL owned by a `mysql` user) you'll need to be a touch more careful. This is a recommendation from the Homebrew project.  **Note** This cookbook _only_ supports installing in `/usr/local`.

Dependencies: The example xinitrc file provided makes calls to launch X clients within the window manager.  Therefore, these X clients need to be already installed on your system: xeyes, xclock, xterm. In order to run the window manager as a client in your current window manager, you'll need xephyr and scons.   There are two options for using this X window manager. Option 1 is to compile the program by installing scons and running the ./build_and_run.sh file without xephyr by setting it as your native window manager (you can use the provided xinitrc file to replace ~/.xinitrc). Option 2 is to install scons, and use xephyr to run the window manager from within your current X session.   It is assumed that the program will be tested before use, so this is the default setting for the build_and_run.sh script.  Execution: Execute the build_and_run.sh file to Make and connect the window manager to the X server as an X client.  ./build_and_run.sh  Once scons compiles our program, xephyr launches a few programs inside of the new window manager.  Congratulations on making it this far! If you had problems installing LightWM see the toubleshooting section at the end of this readme.  Commands:  Close (kill) a window: ALT + Q  Move a window: Hold ALT and select a window with the mouse. Drag to reposition. Release mouse to stop.  Launch a new xterm window as a child process: ALT + Enter  Cycle top window focus: ALT + Tab  And of course, feel free to launch any program via xterm.  Troubleshooting: Make sure to install xorg-xeyes, xorg-xclock, xterm, xephyr (unless using lightWM as primary window manager), and scons with your operating system's package manager. LightWM does not support multiple monitor X configurations, and may be unable to load xorg.conf configuration files with multiple screens."

2790,247,https://github.com/gaopeng9090/IntentKit,# IntentKit [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/intentkit/IntentKit.png)](https://travis-ci.org/intentkit/IntentKit),123,gaopeng9090.IntentKit.md,1,"=========  IntentKit is an easier way to handle third-party URL schemes in iOS apps.  ![Example of activity view](https://raw.github.com/intentkit/IntentKit/master/example.gif)   Linking to third-party apps is essentially broken on iOS. Let's say that, as a developer, you want to allow users to open map links in Google Maps instead of the built-in Maps.app. You now need to write a whole bunch of custom code that determines whether Google Maps is installed, ask the user which they would prefer, and ideally remember that preference.  If we take a more complex example, like Twitter clients, you're now potentially managing a dozen different third-party URL schemes that are all drastically different and quite possibly poorly-documented.  As a result, very few apps link to external third-party apps for tasks handled by Apple's easier-to-link-to apps, even when users prefer third-party apps.  IntentKit attempts to solve this problem.  **For users**, it provides a beautiful selection interface to choose which third-party app to perform an action in.  **For developers**, it provides:  - An elegant, cohesive API based on semantic actions. Instead of manually constructing URLs or creating modal view controllers to display, just tell it what you're trying to do. Instead of manually checking which applications a user has installed, let IntentKit automatically query the device for you to figure out what applications are available to perform a given action.  - A unified, human-readable repository of third-party URL schemes. Every application's URL scheme is just a plaintext plist. You can add support for your application to IntentKit without writing a single line of code.  "
2791,247,https://github.com/gaopeng9090/IntentKit,## Installation,3,gaopeng9090.IntentKit.md,2,"------------ IntentKit is easiest to install using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). Just add the following to your Podfile.      pod ""IntentKit""   After running `pod install`, you should be able to #import any INKHandler header file (e.g. `#import <INKMailHandler.h>`) and go to town.  If you're concerned about the increase in your app bundle's size, you can choose to only include a subset of IntentKit's supported applications. Subspecs exist for each handler class.      # Only includes web browsers     pod ""IntentKit/Browsers""  For more information on what subspecs are available, refer to the project's [Podspec](https://github.com/intentkit/IntentKit/blob/master/IntentKit.podspec).  "
2792,247,https://github.com/gaopeng9090/IntentKit,## Usage,3,gaopeng9090.IntentKit.md,2,"-----  To use IntentKit, you start by instantiating a handler object. There are a handful of handler objects that come with IntentKit, each with domain knowledge of a specific type of application. For example, `INKBrowserHandler`, `INKMapsHandler`, and `INKTwitterHandler` handle opening links in web browsers, mapping applications, and Twitter clients, respectively.  After creating a new handler object, you just tell it what action you want to perform. It will return you a special object called a presenter, which can be used to actually perform the action. Here's how you'd open an email compose screen on an iPhone:  ```obj-c INKMailHandler *mailHandler = [[INKMailHandler alloc] init]; [[mailHandler sendMailTo:@""steve@apple.com""] presentModally]; ```  If the user doesn't have any third-party mail apps installed (such as Mailbox or Google's native Gmail app), this will display an in-line `MFMailComposeViewController`, just as if you had created and presented one yourself. If the user does have other mail apps installed, this will display a modal sheet that looks like a `UIActivityViewController` listing each available application. It will also give them a switch they can tap to remember their choice for all future links of that type.  "

2814,248,https://github.com/kuyoska/embedio,## REST API Example:,3,kuyoska.embedio.md,2,"-----------------  The WebApi module supports two routing strategies: Wildcard and Regex. By default, and in order to maintain backwards compatibility, the WebApi module will use the **Wildcard Routing Strategy** and match routes using the asterisk `*` character in the route. **For example:** - The route `/api/people/*` will match any request with a URL starting with the two first URL segments `api` and `people` and ending with anything. The route `/api/people/hello` will be matched. - You can also use wildcards in the middle of the route. The route `/api/people/*/details` will match requests starting with the two first URL segments `api` and `people`, and ending with a `details` segment. The route `/api/people/hello/details` will be matched.  *Note that most REST services can be designed with this simpler Wildcard routing startegy. However, the Regex matching strategy is the current recommended approach as we might be deprecating the Wildcard strategy altogether*  On the other hand, the **Regex Routing Strategy** will try to match and resolve the values from a route template, in a similar fashion to Microsoft's Web API 2. A method with the following route `/api/people/{id}` is going to match any request URL with three segments: the first two `api` and `people` and the last one is going to be parsed or converted to the type in the `id` argument of the handling method signature. Please read on if this was confusing as it is much simpler than it sounds. Additionally, you can put multiple values to match, for example `/api/people/{mainSkill}/{age}`, and receive the parsed values from the URL straight into the arguments of your handler method.  *During server setup:*  ```csharp // The routing strategy is Wildcard by default, but you can change it to Regex as follows: var server =  new WebServer(""http://localhost:9696/"", RoutingStrategy.Regex);  server.RegisterModule(new WebApiModule()); server.Module<WebApiModule>().RegisterController<PeopleController>(); ```  *And our controller class (using Regex Strategy) looks like:*  ```csharp public class PeopleController : WebApiController {     [WebApiHandler(HttpVerbs.Get, ""/api/people/{id}"")]     public bool GetPeople(WebServer server, HttpListenerContext context, int id)     {         try         {             if (People.Any(p => p.Key == id))             {                 return context.JsonResponse(People.FirstOrDefault(p => p.Key == id));             }         }         catch (Exception ex)         {             return HandleError(context, ex, (int)HttpStatusCode.InternalServerError);         }     }      protected bool HandleError(HttpListenerContext context, Exception ex, int statusCode = 500)     {         var errorResponse = new         {             Title = ""Unexpected Error"",             ErrorCode = ex.GetType().Name,             Description = ex.ExceptionMessage(),         };          context.Response.StatusCode = statusCode;         return context.JsonResponse(errorResponse);     } } ```  *Or if you want to use the Wildcard strategy (which is the default):*  ```csharp public class PeopleController : WebApiController {     [WebApiHandler(HttpVerbs.Get, ""/api/people/*"")]     public bool GetPeople(WebServer server, HttpListenerContext context)     {         try         {             var lastSegment = context.Request.Url.Segments.Last();             if (lastSegment.EndsWith(""/""))                 return context.JsonResponse(People);              int key = 0;             if (int.TryParse(lastSegment, out key) && People.Any(p => p.Key == key))             {                 return context.JsonResponse(People.FirstOrDefault(p => p.Key == key));             }              throw new KeyNotFoundException(""Key Not Found: "" + lastSegment);         }         catch (Exception ex)         {             return HandleError(context, ex, (int)HttpStatusCode.InternalServerError);         }     }      protected bool HandleError(HttpListenerContext context, Exception ex, int statusCode = 500)     {         var errorResponse = new         {             Title = ""Unexpected Error"",             ErrorCode = ex.GetType().Name,             Description = ex.ExceptionMessage(),         };          context.Response.StatusCode = statusCode;         return context.JsonResponse(errorResponse);     } } ``` "

Since React makes no assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, it's easy to try it out on a small feature in an existing project. * **Virtual DOM:** React abstracts away the DOM from you, giving a simpler programming model and better performance. React can also render on the server using Node, and it can power native apps using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/). * **Data flow:** React implements one-way reactive data flow which reduces boilerplate and is easier to reason about than traditional data binding.  **NEW**!

The following entries are required:  ``` 127.0.0.1   web-platform.test 127.0.0.1   www.web-platform.test 127.0.0.1   www1.web-platform.test 127.0.0.1   www2.web-platform.test 127.0.0.1   xn--n8j6ds53lwwkrqhv28a.web-platform.test 127.0.0.1   xn--lve-6lad.web-platform.test 0.0.0.0     nonexistent-origin.web-platform.test ```  If you are behind a proxy, you also need to make sure the domains above are excluded from your proxy lookups.  Because web-platform-tests uses git submodules, you must ensure that these are up to date. In the root of your checkout, run:  ``` git submodule update --init --recursive ```  The test environment can then be started using      ./serve  This will start HTTP servers on two ports and a websockets server on one port. By default one web server starts on port 8000 and the other ports are randomly-chosen free ports. Tests must be loaded from the *first* HTTP server in the output. To change the ports, copy the `config.default.json` file to `config.json` and edit the new file, replacing the part that reads:  ``` ""http"": [8000, ""auto""] ```  to some port of your choice e.g.  ``` ""http"": [1234, ""auto""] ```  If you installed OpenSSL in such a way that running `openssl` at a command line doesn't work, you also need to adjust the path to the OpenSSL binary. This can be done by adding a section to `config.json` like:  ``` ""ssl"": {""openssl"": {""binary"": ""/path/to/openssl""}} ``` "
2838,251,https://github.com/rune-opera/web-platform-tests,"# <span id=windows-notes"">Windows Notes</span>""",3,rune-opera.web-platform-tests.md,1,"=============================================  Running wptserve with SSL enabled on Windows typically requires installing an OpenSSL distribution. [Shining Light](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html) provide a convenient installer that is known to work, but requires a little extra setup, i.e.:  Run the installer for Win32_OpenSSL_v1.1.0b (30MB). During installation, change the default location for where to Copy OpenSSL Dlls from the System directory to the /bin directory.  After installation, ensure that the path to OpenSSL (typically, this will be `C:\OpenSSL-Win32\bin`) is in your `%Path%` [Environment Variable](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm). If you forget to do this part, you will most likely see a 'File Not Found' error when you start wptserve.  Finally, set the path value in the server configuration file to the default OpenSSL configuration file location. To do this, copy `config.default.json` in the web-platform-tests root to `config.json`. Then edit the JSON so that the key `ssl/openssl/base_conf_path` has a value that is the path to the OpenSSL config file (typically this will be `C:\\OpenSSL-Win32\\bin\\openssl.cfg`).  Alternatively, you may also use [Bash on Ubuntu on Windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about) in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update build, then access your windows partition from there to launch wptserve.

If you want to ensure (e.g., for security reasons) that such scripts won't be handled by the HTTP server, but will instead only be usable from the command line, then place them in either:  * the `tools` subdir at the root of the repository, or  * the `tools` subdir at the root of any top-level directory in the   repository which contains the tests the script is meant to be used   with  Any files in those `tools` directories won't be handled by the HTTP server; instead the server will return a 404 if a user navigates to the URL for a file within them.  If you want to add a script for use with a particular set of tests but there isn't yet any `tools` subdir at the root of a top-level directory in the repository containing those tests, you can create a `tools` subdir at the root of that top-level directory and place your scripts there.  For example, if you wanted to add a script for use with tests in the `notifications` directory, create the `notifications/tools` subdir and put your script there. "

If you are interested in receiving notifications of proposed changes to tests in a given directory, feel free to add yourself to the OWNERS file.

Install Gemstash to get started:  ``` $ gem install gemstash ```  After it is installed, starting Gemstash requires no additional steps. Simply start the Gemstash server with the `gemstash` command:  ``` $ gemstash start ```  You may have noticed that the command finished quickly. This is because Gemstash will run the server in the background by default. The server runs on port 9292. "
2891,255,https://github.com/larssonandreas/gemstash,### Bundling,3,larssonandreas.gemstash.md,3," With the server running, you can bundle against it. Tell Bundler that you want to use Gemstash to find gems from RubyGems.org:  ``` $ bundle config mirror.https://rubygems.org http://localhost:9292 ```  Now you can create a Gemfile and install gems through Gemstash:  ```ruby"
2892,255,https://github.com/larssonandreas/gemstash,# ./Gemfile,-,larssonandreas.gemstash.md,1,"source ""https://rubygems.org"" gem ""rubywarrior"" ```  The gems you include should be gems you don't yet have installed, otherwise Gemstash will have nothing to stash. Now bundle:  ``` $ bundle install --path .bundle ```  Your Gemstash server has fetched the gems from https://www.rubygems.org and cached them for you! To prove this, you can disable your Internet connection and try again. The gem dependencies from https://www.rubygems.org are cached for 30 minutes, so if you bundle again before that, you can successfully bundle without an Internet connection:  ``` $ # Disable your Internet first! $ rm -rf Gemfile.lock .bundle $ bundle ``` "
2893,255,https://github.com/larssonandreas/gemstash,### Stopping the Server,3,larssonandreas.gemstash.md,3," Once you've finish using your Gemstash server, you can stop it just as easily as you started it:  ``` $ gemstash stop ```  You'll also want to tell Bundler that it can go back to getting gems from RubyGems.org directly, instead of going through Gemstash:  ``` $ bundle config --delete mirror.https://rubygems.org ``` "
2894,255,https://github.com/larssonandreas/gemstash,### Under the Hood,3,larssonandreas.gemstash.md,3," You might wonder where the gems are stored. After running the commands above, you will find a new directory at `~/.gemstash`. This directory holds all the cached and private gems. It also has a server log, the database, and configuration for Gemstash. If you prefer, you can [point to a different directory](docs/config.md#files).  Gemstash uses [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) to store details about private gems. The database will be located in `~/.gemstash`, however you won't see the database appear until you start using private gems. If you prefer, you can [use a different database](docs/config.md#database).  Gemstash temporarily caches things like gem dependencies in memory. Anything cached in memory will last for 30 minutes before being retrieved again. You can [use memcached](docs/config.md#cache) instead of caching in memory. Gem files are always cached permanently, so bundling with a `Gemfile.lock` with all gems cached will never call out to https://www.rubygems.org.  The server you ran is provided via [Puma](http://puma.io/) and [Rack](http://rack.github.io/), however they are not customizable at this point. "

2912,258,https://github.com/omedbb/volume-leather-fill,### Issues and pending improvements,3,omedbb.volume-leather-fill.md,3," Currently the searching depth is 2 and it fails sometimes. You can increase the number to 3 or more by changing the return value of `- (NSInteger)maximumSearchingDepth` in `M2GlobalState+AI.h`.  Ideally, the AI should search from 0 depth to infinity and have a time out, it records the current best move when finish searching the current depth and stops immediately when timed out and return the best move so far. However, I have a little bit of trouble when dealing with `NSOperationQueue` so I didn't do it this way. Now the AI only searches at the specified `-maximumSearchingDepth`. "
2913,258,https://github.com/omedbb/volume-leather-fill,## The Game,1,omedbb.volume-leather-fill.md,2," Since it is a *derivative* of the original 2048, it is not the *same*. More explicitly, it has the following additions:  * **Three board sizes**: 3x3, 4x4 and 5x5. The smaller the board is, the fewer cells you have, and the harder the game is.* * **Three game modes**: The original Power of 2, i.e. combining two tiles of the same value to produce their sum. The Power of 3, i.e. combining *three* consecutive tiles of the same value to produce their sum. Not surprisingly, this is pretty hard with the 3x3 board, although I found it pretty easy to get 81. 243 is a different story... And the Fibonacci sequence, i.e. combining two adjacent numbers in the sequence 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... (I omitted the two 1's in the beginning) to produce the one next to the larger value. This is pretty tricky. Try it out and you will know what I mean. * **Three themes**: I made a bright theme and a 'joyful' theme in addition to the original one. In case you wonder how to do themes in iOS. (There may be a better way, but themes are verbose in nature, because you *have to* specify all the colors, fonts, etc.) "
2914,258,https://github.com/omedbb/volume-leather-fill,## The Technology,13,omedbb.volume-leather-fill.md,2," This version of 2048 is built using SpriteKit, the new 2-D game engine Apple introduced to iOS 7. As a result, it requires iOS 7 to run. On the other hand, this app has the following two great properties:  * It does not rely on *any* third-party library. Not that Cocos-2D is not great, but the fact it's using SpriteKit means that it does not have any dependencies. * It does not have any images. That's right. The entire UI is done either via UIKit, or by Core Graphics. Check out the related files to see how that is done, if you are curious.  You should be able to download the source, and build and run without problem. However, please note that you may not want to run it in the simulator unless you don't have an Apple Developer account. SpriteKit does use OpenGL, and simulating that using CPU will cause your computer to take off. "
2915,258,https://github.com/omedbb/volume-leather-fill,## The Code,3,omedbb.volume-leather-fill.md,2," First off, the best thing about the code is that it's pretty well documented. Most methods have the Apple-style documentation, which means that you can triple-click on the method name to get its documentation.  The code started to resemble the structure of the original 2048. So for example, it has a game manager, a board class, a tile class, etc. I at least *tried* to stick to MVC as much as possible. Here is a brief summary to get you started:  * The `M2GameManager` class controls the game logic. There is only one action in the game: move. So the majority of that class is handling the move. The rest is checking whether you've won or died, etc. * The `M2Grid` class is the data structure for the board. The original 2048 used a 1-D array, but heck, 2-D array doesn't seem to be too bad here! ...except looping it is a bit ugly, so I made a `forEach` helper function. * The `M2Cell` class is the ""slot""s. They are not the tiles themselves. The benefit of having this class is that the cells never move, so they are good references and they don't mess stuff up. * The `M2Tile` class is the actual tile, and **this** is the actual SpriteKit class. If all you want is some sample code for SpriteKit, here it is. I believe my animations are smoother than the other 2048 on the App Store, and are closer to the original animation. * The `M2GlobalState` class is a global class accessible from anywhere in the universe. Well, global stuff is evil, right? At least so we are told. But, it is at least better to encapsulate the global stuff into one single object (namespace), and that's a singleton right there. * The `M2Theme` class and its subclasses control the theme. * There are also some controller classes and view classes. It's probably a better idea to do the Game Over scene in SpriteKit, but I was lazy so I faked it using a view. The `M2GridView` class is the one that draws the board, btw. "

2929,260,https://github.com/bkachamakov/FreeCodeCamp,## Contributing,7,bkachamakov.FreeCodeCamp.md,2,"------------  We welcome pull requests from Free Code Camp campers (our students) and seasoned JavaScript developers alike! Follow these steps to contribute:  1.  Check our [public Waffle Board](https://waffle.io/freecodecamp/freecodecamp). 2.  Pick an issue that nobody has claimed and start working on it. If your issue isn't on the board, open an issue. If you think you can fix it yourself, start working on it. Feel free to ask for help in our [Gitter](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp). 3.  Fork the project ([Need help with forking a project?](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)). You'll do all of your work on your forked copy. 4.  Create a branch specific to the issue or feature you are working on. Push your work to that branch. ([Need help with branching?](https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches)) 5.  Name the branch something like  `user-xxx` where user is your username and xxx is the issue number you are addressing. 6.  You should have [ESLint running in your editor](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations.html), and it will highlight anything doesn't conform to [AirBnB's JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).  Please do not ignore any linting errors, as they are meant to **help** you. Make sure none of your JavaScript is longer than 80 characters per line. 7.  Once your code is ready, submit a pull request from your branch to Free Code Camp's `staging` branch. We'll do a quick code review and give you feedback, then iterate from there. 8.  Once we accept one of your pull requests, one of the project owners (currently @quincylarson, @terakilobyte, and @berkeleytrue) will add you to our camper contributor group. "

Finally, it publishes to raven_automove.msg ROS topic. 2. **listenerAutoCircle** : This ROS node is only for testing. It serves the same purpose as the main RAVEN software, and will be replaced during actual use. It communicates with the talkerAutoCircle by listening to the motion commands and sends out RAVEN position and orientation feedback after following the command. Thus, it subscribes to raven_automove.msg ROS topic, and updates RAVEN position and orientation accordingly, then publishes raven_state.msg ROS topic to show how the robot arm is currently posed.  "

The seed contains a sample AngularJS application and is preconfigured to install the Angular framework and a bunch of development and testing tools for instant web development gratification.  The seed app doesn't do much, just shows how to wire two controllers and views together.  "
2981,266,https://github.com/manuelbrand/WeatherPage,## Getting Started,3,manuelbrand.WeatherPage.md,2, To get you started you can simply clone the angular-seed repository and install the dependencies: 
2982,266,https://github.com/manuelbrand/WeatherPage,### Prerequisites,3,manuelbrand.WeatherPage.md,3, You need git to clone the angular-seed repository. You can get git from [http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).  We also use a number of node.js tools to initialize and test angular-seed. You must have node.js and its package manager (npm) installed.  You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/). 
2983,266,https://github.com/manuelbrand/WeatherPage,### Clone angular-seed,3,manuelbrand.WeatherPage.md,3, Clone the angular-seed repository using [git][git]:  ``` git clone https://github.com/angular/angular-seed.git cd angular-seed ```  If you just want to start a new project without the angular-seed commit history then you can do:  ```bash git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/angular/angular-seed.git <your-project-name> ```  The `depth=1` tells git to only pull down one commit worth of historical data. 
2984,266,https://github.com/manuelbrand/WeatherPage,### Install Dependencies,3,manuelbrand.WeatherPage.md,3," We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and angular framework code.  The tools help us manage and test the application.  * We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm]. * We get the angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].  We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:  ``` npm install ```  Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`.  You should find that you have two new folders in your project.  * `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need * `app/bower_components` - contains the angular framework files  *Note that the `bower_components` folder would normally be installed in the root folder but angular-seed changes this location through the `.bowerrc` file.  Putting it in the app folder makes it easier to serve the files by a webserver.* "
2985,266,https://github.com/manuelbrand/WeatherPage,### Run the Application,3,manuelbrand.WeatherPage.md,3, We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start this server is:  ``` npm start ```  Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000/index.html`.

2987,266,https://github.com/manuelbrand/WeatherPage,## Testing,3,manuelbrand.WeatherPage.md,2, There are two kinds of tests in the angular-seed application: Unit tests and end-to-end tests. 
2988,266,https://github.com/manuelbrand/WeatherPage,### Running Unit Tests,3,manuelbrand.WeatherPage.md,3," The angular-seed app comes preconfigured with unit tests. These are written in [Jasmine][jasmine], which we run with the [Karma Test Runner][karma]. We provide a Karma configuration file to run them.  * the configuration is found at `karma.conf.js` * the unit tests are found next to the code they are testing and are named as `..._test.js`.  The easiest way to run the unit tests is to use the supplied npm script:  ``` npm test ```  This script will start the Karma test runner to execute the unit tests. Moreover, Karma will sit and watch the source and test files for changes and then re-run the tests whenever any of them change. This is the recommended strategy; if your unit tests are being run every time you save a file then you receive instant feedback on any changes that break the expected code functionality.  You can also ask Karma to do a single run of the tests and then exit.  This is useful if you want to check that a particular version of the code is operating as expected.  The project contains a predefined script to do this:  ``` npm run test-single-run ```  "
2989,266,https://github.com/manuelbrand/WeatherPage,### End to end testing,3,manuelbrand.WeatherPage.md,3," The angular-seed app comes with end-to-end tests, again written in [Jasmine][jasmine]. These tests are run with the [Protractor][protractor] End-to-End test runner.  It uses native events and has special features for Angular applications.  * the configuration is found at `e2e-tests/protractor-conf.js` * the end-to-end tests are found in `e2e-tests/scenarios.js`  Protractor simulates interaction with our web app and verifies that the application responds correctly. Therefore, our web server needs to be serving up the application, so that Protractor can interact with it.  ``` npm start ```  In addition, since Protractor is built upon WebDriver we need to install this.  The angular-seed project comes with a predefined script to do this:  ``` npm run update-webdriver ```  This will download and install the latest version of the stand-alone WebDriver tool.  Once you have ensured that the development web server hosting our application is up and running and WebDriver is updated, you can run the end-to-end tests using the supplied npm script:  ``` npm run protractor ```  This script will execute the end-to-end tests against the application being hosted on the development server.  **Note:** Under the hood, Protractor uses the [Selenium Standalone Server][selenium], which in turn requires the [Java Development Kit (JDK)][jdk] to be installed on your local machine. Check this by running `java -version` from the command line.  If JDK is not already installed, you can download it [here][jdk-download].  "
2990,266,https://github.com/manuelbrand/WeatherPage,## Updating Angular,3,manuelbrand.WeatherPage.md,2, Previously we recommended that you merge in changes to angular-seed into your own fork of the project. Now that the angular framework library code and tools are acquired through package managers (npm and bower) you can use these tools instead to update the dependencies.  You can update the tool dependencies by running:  ``` npm update ```  This will find the latest versions that match the version ranges specified in the `package.json` file.  You can update the Angular dependencies by running:  ``` bower update ```  This will find the latest versions that match the version ranges specified in the `bower.json` file.  
2991,266,https://github.com/manuelbrand/WeatherPage,## Loading Angular Asynchronously,3,manuelbrand.WeatherPage.md,2, The angular-seed project supports loading the framework and application scripts asynchronously.  The special `index-async.html` is designed to support this style of loading.  For it to work you must inject a piece of Angular JavaScript into the HTML page.  The project has a predefined script to help do this.  ``` npm run update-index-async ```  This will copy the contents of the `angular-loader.js` library file into the `index-async.html` page. You can run this every time you update the version of Angular that you are using.  
2992,266,https://github.com/manuelbrand/WeatherPage,## Serving the Application Files,3,manuelbrand.WeatherPage.md,2," While angular is client-side-only technology and it's possible to create angular webapps that don't require a backend server at all, we recommend serving the project files using a local webserver during development to avoid issues with security restrictions (sandbox) in browsers. The sandbox implementation varies between browsers, but quite often prevents things like cookies, xhr, etc to function properly when an html page is opened via `file://` scheme instead of `http://`.  "
2993,266,https://github.com/manuelbrand/WeatherPage,### Running the App during Development,3,manuelbrand.WeatherPage.md,3," The angular-seed project comes preconfigured with a local development webserver.  It is a node.js tool called [http-server][http-server].  You can start this webserver with `npm start` but you may choose to install the tool globally:  ``` sudo npm install -g http-server ```  Then you can start your own development web server to serve static files from a folder by running:  ``` http-server -a localhost -p 8000 ```  Alternatively, you can choose to configure your own webserver, such as apache or nginx. Just configure your server to serve the files under the `app/` directory.  "
2994,266,https://github.com/manuelbrand/WeatherPage,### Running the App in Production,3,manuelbrand.WeatherPage.md,3," This really depends on how complex your app is and the overall infrastructure of your system, but the general rule is that all you need in production are all the files under the `app/` directory. Everything else should be omitted.  Angular apps are really just a bunch of static html, css and js files that just need to be hosted somewhere they can be accessed by browsers.  If your Angular app is talking to the backend server via xhr or other means, you need to figure out what is the best way to host the static files to comply with the same origin policy if applicable. Usually this is done by hosting the files by the backend server or through reverse-proxying the backend server(s) and webserver(s).  "
2995,266,https://github.com/manuelbrand/WeatherPage,## Continuous Integration,3,manuelbrand.WeatherPage.md,2,
2996,266,https://github.com/manuelbrand/WeatherPage,### Travis CI,3,manuelbrand.WeatherPage.md,3," [Travis CI][travis] is a continuous integration service, which can monitor GitHub for new commits to your repository and execute scripts such as building the app or running tests. The angular-seed project contains a Travis configuration file, `.travis.yml`, which will cause Travis to run your tests when you push to GitHub.  You will need to enable the integration between Travis and GitHub. See the Travis website for more instruction on how to do this. "
2997,266,https://github.com/manuelbrand/WeatherPage,### CloudBees,3,manuelbrand.WeatherPage.md,3," CloudBees have provided a CI/deployment setup:  <a href=""https://grandcentral.cloudbees.com/?CB_clickstart=https://raw.github.com/CloudBees-community/angular-js-clickstart/master/clickstart.json""> <img src=""https://d3ko533tu1ozfq.cloudfront.net/clickstart/deployInstantly.png""/></a>  If you run this, you will get a cloned version of this repo to start working on in a private git repo, along with a CI service (in Jenkins) hosted that will run unit and end to end tests in both Firefox and Chrome.

Explain basics of working with strings 3. Explain the difference between `return` and logging 4. Practice using `return` and `console.log()` 
3021,270,https://github.com/peteryunkim/javascript-intro-to-functions-lab-web-031317,## Introduction,1,peteryunkim.javascript-intro-to-functions-lab-web-031317.md,2," Welcome to the JavaScript functions lab! You'll notice a few new things in this lesson that we haven't encountered before. Don't worry, we'll walk you through them.  Even if you've walked through some of this material before, it's a good idea to review as we code-along — we're writing functions now, after all. "
3022,270,https://github.com/peteryunkim/javascript-intro-to-functions-lab-web-031317,### Code-along,3,peteryunkim.javascript-intro-to-functions-lab-web-031317.md,3," For now, open up `index.js` in your text editor. You should see, well, nothing. We'll fix that soon.  Now open up `test/index-test.js`. Hey, there's something! What's all of this stuff doing?  At the very top of the file, you'll see  ``` javascript global.expect = require('expect');  const babel = require('babel-core'); const jsdom = require('jsdom'); const path = require('path'); ```  This might be a bit bewildering, but all we're doing is referencing different _libraries_ that help us run your tests. A library is code that someone else (usually multiple someone elses) wrote for our use. Note that `require` won't work out of the box in the browser. We're actually running our tests in a different _environment_. (Remember the sandbox analogy from earlier? It's just like that.)  If you go to `test/index-test.js`, you'll see  ``` javascript describe('shout(string)', () => {   // there's stuff in here, too }) ```  `describe` is a function provided by our test runner (in this case, we're using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)) — it's basically a container for our tests.  Let's take a closer look at that `describe()`:  ``` javascript describe('shout(string)', () => {   it('receives one argument and returns it in all caps', () => {     // we'll get to this in a sec   }) }) ```  These internal `describe()` calls are used for _describing_ the functions that you're going to write. In this case, the test is saying, ""Okay, I think there's going to be a function called `shout`, and it should take one argument (it doesn't actually matter what the argument is called, but `string`, is nice and specific, don't you think?). It should _return_ that argument in all caps.  Finally, we have  ``` javascript expect(shout('hello')).toEqual('HELLO') ```  which says that it _expects_ a call to `shout()` with the string `'hello'` will `equal` the string `'HELLO'`. This is the actual test — otherwise called a spec, expectation, or assertion — for this function. We can have more than one test per function, but let's start with this one. "
3023,270,https://github.com/peteryunkim/javascript-intro-to-functions-lab-web-031317,### Running the Tests,3,peteryunkim.javascript-intro-to-functions-lab-web-031317.md,3," To run the tests, run `learn test` in the terminal in your Learn IDE. The first output you'll see will look like  ![test fail](https://s3.amazonaws.com/learn-verified/javascript-intro-to-functions-lab-0-tests-passing.png)  Hm, that's kind of disappointing. Let's see if we can get that first test to pass. Open up `index.js`.  When we write our code, we follow the guidance of the tests. Remember the line, `describe('shout(string)', () => { ... })`. Well, we know that we need a function called `shout` that accepts an argument — let's add that first. In `index.js`:  ``` javascript function shout(string) { } ```  And what should that function do? Well, the `it()` description tells us that it ""receives one argument and returns it in all caps"".  Okay, so with that information, we know that our function should look like  ``` javascript function shout(string) {   return string } ```  But how do we make `string` all caps? JavaScript has a method for that! It's called `toUpperCase()`. We can call it on any string:  ``` javascript 'Hello!'.toUpperCase() // 'HELLO!' ```  So let's try it with our `shout()` function:  ``` javascript function shout(string) {   return string.toUpperCase() } ```  And run our tests again:  ``` javascript learn test ```  ![first test passing](https://s3.amazonaws.com/learn-verified/javascript-intro-to-functions-lab-1-test-passing.png)  Hey! We got one to pass! "
3024,270,https://github.com/peteryunkim/javascript-intro-to-functions-lab-web-031317,## Your turn,3,peteryunkim.javascript-intro-to-functions-lab-web-031317.md,2," Now it's your turn to get the rest of the tests to pass. Note that some of them require you to use `console.log()` instead of `return` — follow the guidance of the tests!  In this lab, we're writing functions that ""speak"" at different volumes — they whisper or they shout. We're going to use what we learn practicing speaking in this way to write another function, `sayHiToGrandma()`, which takes our new-found speaking ability to greet our grandmother. She's not exactly deaf, but whispering can be a bit difficult. But she'll always hear you if you say, ""I love you, Grandma.""  Note that just like `.toUpperCase()` changes any string to all uppercase in JavaScript, `.toLowerCase()` (e.g., `'HELLO'.toLowerCase()`) changes any string to all lowercase.  Additionally, how do we check if a string is all lowercase or all uppercase?  ```javascript var uppercase = ""HELLO!""  uppercase.toUpperCase() === uppercase // true  var lowercase = 'hello!'  lowercase.toLowerCase() === lowercase // true  var mixedCase = 'Hi there!'  mixedCase.toLowerCase() === mixedCase // false  mixedCase.toUpperCase() === mixedCase // false ```  We can simply check whether the string is the same when we convert it to uppercase or lowercase! If it's the same, then it was already in that case; if not, then it's either in the other case or it's mixed case.  Good luck!

3026,271,https://github.com/lindes/vrptools,## What is this?,12,lindes.vrptools.md,2,"-------------  [Vision Research](http://www.visionresearch.com/) is a company that makes some pretty amazing high-speed video cameras, which generally have the word Phantom in their name.  Their products run the gamut from doing [4K video](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution) at 140 frames per second (fps) with the [Phantom 65](http://www.visionresearch.com/Products/High-Speed-Cameras/Phantom-65/), all the way to an unbelievable 1,400,000 (yes, 1.4 *million*) fps (though at a mere 128x8 *pixels*, no M, no K) on the [Phantom v710](http://www.visionresearch.com/Products/High-Speed-Cameras/v710/) -- with, of course, a whole breadth of in-between speeds and resolutions, including some pretty impressive frame-rates at [1080p](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p) on some models (e.g. 2,560 fps on the [v641](http://www.visionresearch.com/Products/High-Speed-Cameras/v641/), to name but one).  This project, then, is an attempt to have a set of open-source utilities for getting data out of the proprietary (though publicly documented) ""CINE"" files.  There are, of course, a number of software packages out there already that will read these files, including the ones from Vision Research, other tools from [Glue Tools](http://www.gluetools.com/products_phantom.html), and others, but I was unable to find an open-source/free-software one, so... here is this (though note the See Also; I've since discovered other projects doing similar things).  The cameras are fairly expensive, so I imagine their availability is limited.  Still, there seem to be more and more people shooting with them (as evidenced by a [video search](http://www.google.com/search?q=phantom+high+speed&um=1&tbs=vid:1&source=og); I got 4110 results as of 2011-02-23, and over 7 million as of 2013-10-08).  Add to this the fact that I happen to occassionaly have had access to one, and I have some files here that I want to read, so, here we are. "
3027,271,https://github.com/lindes/vrptools,## Status,4,lindes.vrptools.md,2,"------  These tools are currently in their *infancy*.  **Please keep your expectations low for this software, for now.**  That said, `cineinfo` is starting to provide some vaguely-useful information about a CINE file, and `cine-extract` will now generate a series of PPM files (in `cine-extract.d` by default; changeable with `-d` option) from one, one per frame.  There's also a ""magic"" file (a la `/etc/magic`).  I haven't yet taken the time to figure out how one would go about installing it on one's system, but you can run `file -M magic foo.cine` and it will give some info.  Probably still needs more content there, and probably also needs to have some of it removed (or migrated to 'magic.verbose' or something), as the output is really verbose at the moment. "
3028,271,https://github.com/lindes/vrptools,## Technical Docs:,6,lindes.vrptools.md,2,"---------------  This tooling is based on documentation which, at the time of this writing, was available for public download at either of:  * [www.visionresearch.com/devzonedownloads/cine640.pdf](http://www.visionresearch.com/devzonedownloads/cine640.pdf)   (original version used, dated 2007) * [www.visionresearch.com/devzonedownloads/cine705.pdf](http://www.visionresearch.com/devzonedownloads/cine705.pdf)   (updated version -- dated 2011, found 2013) "

3034,271,https://github.com/lindes/vrptools,## See Also,6,lindes.vrptools.md,2,"--------  There's a related project called [pycine](https://github.com/adamdlight/pyCine), which uses native [Python](http://www.python.org/) code to read CINE files."
3035,272,https://github.com/adrian907/neuraltalk2,# NeuralTalk2,12,adrian907.neuraltalk2.md,1,"  Recurrent Neural Network captions your images. Now much faster and better than the original [NeuralTalk](https://github.com/karpathy/neuraltalk). Compared to the original NeuralTalk this implementation is **batched, uses Torch, runs on a GPU, and supports CNN finetuning**. All of these together result in quite a large increase in training speed for the Language Model (~100x), but overall not as much because we also have to forward a VGGNet. However, overall very good models can be trained in 2-3 days, and they show a much better performance.  This is an early code release that works great but is slightly hastily released and probably requires some code reading of inline comments (which I tried to be quite good with in general). I will be improving it over time but wanted to push the code out there because I promised it to too many people.  This current code (and the pretrained model) gets ~0.9 CIDEr, which would place it around spot #8 on the [codalab leaderboard](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/3221#results). I will submit the actual result soon.  ![teaser results](https://raw.github.com/karpathy/neuraltalk2/master/vis/teaser.jpeg)  You can find a few more example results on the [demo page](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/neuraltalk2/demo.html). These results will improve a bit more once the last few bells and whistles are in place (e.g. beam search, ensembling, reranking).  There's also a [fun video](https://vimeo.com/146492001) by [@kcimc](https://twitter.com/kcimc), where he runs a neuraltalk2 pretrained model in real time on his laptop during a walk in Amsterdam. "
3036,272,https://github.com/adrian907/neuraltalk2,### Requirements,3,adrian907.neuraltalk2.md,3, 
3037,272,https://github.com/adrian907/neuraltalk2,#### For evaluation only,3,adrian907.neuraltalk2.md,4," This code is written in Lua and requires [Torch](http://torch.ch/). If you're on Ubuntu, installing Torch in your home directory may look something like:  ```bash $ curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torch/ezinstall/master/install-deps | bash $ git clone https://github.com/torch/distro.git ~/torch --recursive $ cd ~/torch; $ ./install.sh      # and enter ""yes"" at the end to modify your bashrc $ source ~/.bashrc ```  See the Torch installation documentation for more details. After Torch is installed we need to get a few more packages using [LuaRocks](https://luarocks.org/) (which already came with the Torch install). In particular:  ```bash $ luarocks install nn $ luarocks install nngraph $ luarocks install image ```  We're also going to need the [cjson](http://www.kyne.com.au/~mark/software/lua-cjson-manual.html) library so that we can load/save json files. Follow their [download link](http://www.kyne.com.au/~mark/software/lua-cjson.php) and then look under their section 2.4 for easy luarocks install.  If you'd like to run on an NVIDIA GPU using CUDA (which you really, really want to if you're training a model, since we're using a VGGNet), you'll of course need a GPU, and you will have to install the [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit). Then get the `cutorch` and `cunn` packages:  ```bash $ luarocks install cutorch $ luarocks install cunn ```  If you'd like to use the cudnn backend (the pretrained checkpoint does), you also have to install [cudnn](https://github.com/soumith/cudnn.torch). First follow the link to [NVIDIA website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuDNN), register with them and download the cudnn library. Then make sure you adjust your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point to the `lib64` folder that contains the library (e.g. `libcudnn.so.7.0.64`). Then git clone the `cudnn.torch` repo, `cd` inside and do `luarocks make cudnn-scm-1.rockspec` to build the Torch bindings. "
3038,272,https://github.com/adrian907/neuraltalk2,#### For training,3,adrian907.neuraltalk2.md,4," If you'd like to train your models you will need [loadcaffe](https://github.com/szagoruyko/loadcaffe), since we are using the VGGNet. First, make sure you follow their instructions to install `protobuf` and everything else (e.g. `sudo apt-get install libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler`), and then install via luarocks:  ```bash luarocks install loadcaffe ```  Finally, you will also need to install [torch-hdf5](https://github.com/deepmind/torch-hdf5), and [h5py](http://www.h5py.org/), since we will be using hdf5 files to store the preprocessed data.  Phew! Quite a few dependencies, sorry no easy way around it :\ "
3039,272,https://github.com/adrian907/neuraltalk2,### I just want to caption images,3,adrian907.neuraltalk2.md,3," In this case you want to run the evaluation script on a pretrained model checkpoint. I trained a decent one on the [MS COCO dataset](http://mscoco.org/) that you can run on your images. The pretrained checkpoint can be downloaded here: [pretrained checkpoint link](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/neuraltalk2/checkpoint_v1.zip) (600MB). It's large because it contains the weights of a finetuned VGGNet. Now place all your images of interest into a folder, e.g. `blah`, and run the eval script:  ```bash $ th eval.lua -model /path/to/model -image_folder /path/to/image/directory -num_images 10 ```  This tells the `eval` script to run up to 10 images from the given folder. If you have a big GPU you can speed up the evaluation by increasing `batch_size` (default = 1). Use `-num_images -1` to process all images. The eval script will create an `vis.json` file inside the `vis` folder, which can then be visualized with the provided HTML interface:  ```bash $ cd vis $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer ```  Now visit `localhost:4000` in your browser and you should see your predicted captions.  You can see an [example visualization demo page here](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/neuraltalk2/demo.html).  **""I only have CPU""**. Okay, in that case download the [cpu model checkpoint](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/neuraltalk2/checkpoint_v1_cpu.zip). Make sure you run the eval script with `-gpuid -1` to tell the script to run on CPU. On my machine it takes a bit less than 1 second per image to caption in CPU mode.  **Beam Search**. Beam search is enabled by default because it increases the performance of the search for argmax decoding sequence. However, this is a little more expensive, so if you'd like to evaluate images faster, but at a cost of performance, use `-beam_size 1`. For example, in one of my experiments beam size 2 gives CIDEr 0.922, and beam size 1 gives CIDEr 0.886.  **Running on MSCOCO images**. If you train on MSCOCO (see how below), you will have generated preprocessed MSCOCO images, which you can use directly in the eval script. In this case simply leave out the `image_folder` option and the eval script and instead pass in the `input_h5`, `input_json` to your preprocessed files. This will make more sense once you read the section below :) "
3040,272,https://github.com/adrian907/neuraltalk2,### I'd like to train my own network on MS COCO,3,adrian907.neuraltalk2.md,3," Great, first we need to some preprocessing. Head over to the `coco/` folder and run the IPython notebook to download the dataset and do some very simple preprocessing. The notebook will combine the train/val data together and create a very simple and small json file that contains a large list of image paths, and raw captions for each image, of the form:  ``` [{ file_path: 'path/img.jpg', captions: ['a caption', ...] }, ...] ```  Once we have this, we're ready to invoke the `prepro.py` script, which will read all of this in and create a dataset (an hdf5 file and a json file) ready for consumption in the Lua code. For example, for MS COCO we can run the prepro file as follows:  ```bash $ python prepro.py --input_json coco/coco_raw.json --num_val 5000 --num_test 5000 --images_root coco/images --word_count_threshold 5 --output_json coco/cocotalk.json --output_h5 coco/cocotalk.h5 ```  This is telling the script to read in all the data (the images and the captions), allocate 5000 images for val/test splits respectively, and map all words that occur <= 5 times to a special `UNK` token. The resulting `json` and `h5` files are about 30GB and contain everything we want to know about the dataset.  **Warning**: the prepro script will fail with the default MSCOCO data because one of their images is corrupted. See [this issue](https://github.com/karpathy/neuraltalk2/issues/4) for the fix, it involves manually replacing one image in the dataset.  The last thing we need is the [VGG-16 Caffe checkpoint](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/very_deep/), (under Models section, ""16-layer model"" bullet point). Put the two files (the prototxt configuration file and the proto binary of weights) somewhere (e.g. a `model` directory), and we're ready to train!  ```bash $ th train.lua -input_h5 coco/cocotalk.h5 -input_json coco/cocotalk.json ```  The train script will take over, and start dumping checkpoints into the folder specified by `checkpoint_path` (default = current folder). You also have to point the train script to the VGGNet protos (see the options inside `train.lua`).  If you'd like to evaluate BLEU/METEOR/CIDEr scores during training in addition to validation cross entropy loss, use `-language_eval 1` option, but don't forget to download the [coco-caption code](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) into `coco-caption` directory.  **A few notes on training.** To give you an idea, with the default settings one epoch of MS COCO images is about 7500 iterations. 1 epoch of training (with no finetuning - notice this is the default) takes about 1 hour and results in validation loss ~2.7 and CIDEr score of ~0.4. By iteration 70,000 CIDEr climbs up to about 0.6 (validation loss at about 2.5) and then will top out at a bit below 0.7 CIDEr. After that additional improvements are only possible by turning on CNN finetuning. I like to do the training in stages, where I first train with no finetuning, and then restart the train script with `-finetune_cnn_after 0` to start finetuning right away, and using `-start_from` flag to continue from the previous model checkpoint. You'll see your score rise up to about 0.9 CIDEr over ~2 days or so (on MS COCO). "
3041,272,https://github.com/adrian907/neuraltalk2,### I'd like to train on my own data,3,adrian907.neuraltalk2.md,3," No problem, create a json file in the exact same form as before:  ``` [{ file_path: 'path/img.jpg', captions: ['a caption', ...] }, ...] ```  and invoke the `prepro.py` script to preprocess all the images and data into and hdf5 file and json file. Then invoke `train.lua` (see detailed options inside code). "
3042,272,https://github.com/adrian907/neuraltalk2,### I'd like to distribute my GPU trained checkpoints for CPU,3,adrian907.neuraltalk2.md,3," Use the script `convert_checkpoint_gpu_to_cpu.lua` to convert your GPU checkpoints to be usable on CPU. See inline documentation for why this separate script is needed. For example:  ```bash th convert_checkpoint_gpu_to_cpu.lua gpu_checkpoint.t7 ```  write the file `gpu_checkpoint.t7_cpu.t7`, which you can now run with `-gpuid -1` in the eval script. "

Now Django Select2 will use hashed paths of fields to generate their Ids. The old scheme of generating random Ids are still there. You can enable that by setting `GENERATE_RANDOM_SELECT2_ID` to `True`.

The changes were many, raising the possibility of backward incompatibility. However, the backward incompatibility would be subtle.  * Auto fields (sub-classes of AutoViewFieldMixin) now accepts `auto_id` parameter. This can be used to provide custom id for the field. The default is 'module.field_class_name'. Ideally only the first instance of an auto field is registered. This parameter can be used to force registration of additional instances by passing a unique value. "

3093,277,https://github.com/SCDesigns/web-auth-readme-v-000,## Objectives,12,SCDesigns.web-auth-readme-v-000.md,2, 1. Understand what OAuth is and why we use it. 2. Use OAuth with the Foursquare API. 
3094,277,https://github.com/SCDesigns/web-auth-readme-v-000,## Lesson,1,SCDesigns.web-auth-readme-v-000.md,2, We're going to expand on our Coffee Shop example to use OAuth with the Foursquare API to perform actions on behalf of an individual user. 
3095,277,https://github.com/SCDesigns/web-auth-readme-v-000,### API User Authentication,3,SCDesigns.web-auth-readme-v-000.md,3," Until now, we've been authenticating to APIs at the *application* level using a Client ID/Secret pair with each request.  As we learned, this level of application authentication is important in that it allows the API provider to ensure good behavior by any client application.  Application-level authentication like this gives us access to application-level functions, for instance, venue search. This is an application-level function because you don't need to be any particular user to search for a coffee shop. In fact, if we look at the [venue search](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/venues/search) API documentation, we see an entry: **Requires Acting User: No** at the top.  Compare that to the documentation for [list friends](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/users/friends), and we see that this function does require an acting user, which makes sense, because the application doesn't have friends, an individual user does.  So, if we want to show our user what their friends are doing, we need a way of authenticating the user to Foursquare through our application.  It's not enough for a user to be logged in to Foursquare and use our app, because Foursquare needs to know that we are acting on *behalf* of a user and that the user has *allowed* that action.  We could write some code to log in on behalf of the user, but that would require us to ask the user for their Foursquare login credentials. Think about that as if you're the user. Are you going to give some random website your login and password for Foursquare? The very thought should make you very suspicious of our motives.  ![fry suspicious](http://i.giphy.com/rApKuVWCZZgvm.gif)  Beyond the security issues, there's the problem of keeping things up to date. If we ask the user to log in to Foursquare on every request, that's a horrible experience.  However, if we store the user's Foursquare login info, we have whole other problems.  The first is that we'd have to store them unencrypted, in plain text, because Fourquare expects a person to log in with their unencrypted credentials. So we have another security problem. Now we have a database full of unencrypted Foursquare credentials waiting for anyone to get in there and grab them all.  Beyond the security issue is a logistical one. If the user changes her password on Foursquare, we'll never know about it, and our app will break. Now she has to update her Foursquare credentials in *two* places, which is cumbersome to say the least. "
3096,277,https://github.com/SCDesigns/web-auth-readme-v-000,### Enter OAuth,3,SCDesigns.web-auth-readme-v-000.md,3," Okay, how do we authenticate a user without them entering their username and password into our application? [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth).  OAuth provides a way for one application to authenticate to another on behalf of a user by means of a revokable, expirable *token*. If our application has a Foursquare token for the user, and someone gets access to our database of tokens, all of them can be revoked and a hacker never gets access to individual user credentials.  An OAuth token also provides a standard way for our application to tell Foursquare ""hey, this user says we can do things for her"", because part of implementing OAuth requires the user to take action on the provider (Foursquare, in this case), explicitly authorizing our application. "
3097,277,https://github.com/SCDesigns/web-auth-readme-v-000,### OAuth Authentication Flow,3,SCDesigns.web-auth-readme-v-000.md,3," OAuth authentication workflow involved three steps at a high level.  1. Request access from the provider site (often via redirect to a    special form) 2. Redirect back to our site with a code 3. Request a token from the provider using the code  Take a look at the [Access token section of the Foursquare API Documentation](https://developer.foursquare.com/overview/auth), specifically the second subsection, under **Code (preferred)**. It describes how to do those three steps with Foursquare. "
3098,277,https://github.com/SCDesigns/web-auth-readme-v-000,#### Checking Authentication,3,SCDesigns.web-auth-readme-v-000.md,4," The first thing we want to do is figure out if a user has already authenticated to Foursquare in this session.  Ultimately, users will be considered ""logged in"" if they have an access token stored in their session. So, let's create a private method `#logged_in?` in your `ApplicationController` that will return false if `session[:token]` is nil and true otherwise:  ```ruby"
3099,277,https://github.com/SCDesigns/web-auth-readme-v-000,# application_controller.rb,-,SCDesigns.web-auth-readme-v-000.md,1, private   def logged_in?     !!session[:token]   end ``` 
3100,277,https://github.com/SCDesigns/web-auth-readme-v-000,#### Redirect Users To Request Foursquare Access,3,SCDesigns.web-auth-readme-v-000.md,4," The first step in the OAuth flow is to direct the user to Foursquare to request access if we haven't already.  According to the [docs](https://developer.foursquare.com/overview/auth), that URL looks like this:  ``` https://foursquare.com/oauth2/authenticate     ?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID     &response_type=code     &redirect_uri=YOUR_REGISTERED_REDIRECT_URI ```  Part of our URL includes passing a `redirect_uri` parameter, so we'll need to set that up. Update your [Foursquare app](https://foursquare.com/developers/apps) and add a Redirect URI. Let's set it to `http://localhost:3000/auth` and save the app.  Because we're going to be using our client ID/secret a lot, instead of always typing it in, let's use a `.env` [file](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) to hold our `FOURSQUARE_CLIENT_ID` and `FOURSQUARE_SECRET` values. Once that's set up, we'll be able to access these values as `ENV['FOURSQUARE_CLIENT_ID']` and `ENV['FOURSQUARE_SECRET']`, which is much easier to keep track of. Follow the instructions to set up Dotenv and add your app's client ID and secret. Don't forget to restart your server after you change any values in `.env`!  **Top-tip:** Dotenv is a great way to keep configuration variables for development, but always remember to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` so you don't share your secrets with everyone else!  Okay, that should handle everything we need to make this first request, so now we need to set up the redirect.  Write another private method `#authenticate_user` that will redirect the user to `https://foursquare.com/oauth2/authenticate` _if_ the user is not already logged in. Then we'll set up a `before_action` to check authentication.  ```ruby"
3101,277,https://github.com/SCDesigns/web-auth-readme-v-000,# application_controller.rb,-,SCDesigns.web-auth-readme-v-000.md,1,"before_action :authenticate_user  private    def authenticate_user     client_id = ENV['FOURSQUARE_CLIENT_ID']     redirect_uri = CGI.escape(""http://localhost:3000/auth"")     foursquare_url = ""https://foursquare.com/oauth2/authenticate?client_id=#{client_id}&response_type=code&redirect_uri=#{redirect_uri}""     redirect_to foursquare_url unless logged_in?   end    def logged_in?     !!session[:token]   end ```  Once you've implemented `#authenticate_user`, set the authentication as a `before_action` in your `ApplicationController`. In your `SessionsController`, skip the `before_action` with `skip_before_action :authenticate_user, only: :create`. Now, whenever users do not have an access token stored in their session, they will be redirected to the Foursquare authorization URL.  Let's try it out. Start your Rails server and try to hit the `/search` page. You should get redirected to Foursquare! Hit the ""Allow"" button and let's see what happens.  Error. Okay. That's good. That means it's working so far. Now we need to implement step two. "

This is where Foursquare is sending users after the login process. Now we need to handle that request.  In your `routes.rb` file, add a route for `get '/auth', to: 'sessions#create'`. This will route that redirect to our `SessionsController` and a `create` action, which is where we'll get the token. So now let's implement that. "

Foursquare redirects users with a code that can be accessed through `params` and exchanged for an access token with a second GET request. We'll need to provide our ID, secret, and the code we just got.  We're going to use [Faraday](https://github.com/lostisland/faraday) to send this request in our controller action. If all goes well, according to the docs we can expect a JSON response with an `access_token`, so we'll parse that and put it in our `session[:token]`.  ```ruby"

Back in our [Foursquare auth docs](https://developer.foursquare.com/overview/auth), under the **Requests** section, we see that all we have to do now is add a `oauth_token` parameter to any request with the user's token.

I only want to register callbacks so I can update my elements accordingly. - Big files should get uploaded without a problem. - I wanted a callback for image previews, that don't kill the browser if too many too big images are viewed. - I want to use the latest API of browsers. I don't care if it falls back to the normal upload form if the browser is too old. - I don't think that it's necessary anymore to depend on libraries such as jQuery (especially when providing functionality that isn't available in old browsers anyway).

3120,279,https://github.com/petems/puppet-splunk,## Overview,1,petems.puppet-splunk.md,2, This module provides a method to deploy Splunk Server or Splunk Universal Forwarder with common configurations and ensure the services maintain a running state. It provides types/providers to interact with the various Splunk/Forwarder configuration files. 
3121,279,https://github.com/petems/puppet-splunk,## Module Description,13,petems.puppet-splunk.md,2," This module does not configure firewall rules. Firewall rules will need to be configured separately in order to allow for correct operation of Splunk and the Splunk Universal Forwarder. Additionally, this module does not supply Splunk or Splunk Universal Forwarder installation media. Installation media will need to be aquired seperately, and the module configured to use it. Users can use yum or apt to install these components if they're self-hosted. "
3122,279,https://github.com/petems/puppet-splunk,## Setup,3,petems.puppet-splunk.md,2,
3123,279,https://github.com/petems/puppet-splunk,### What splunk affects,3,petems.puppet-splunk.md,3, * Installs the Splunk/Forwarder package and manages their config files. It does   not purge them by default. * The module will set up both Splunk and Splunkforwarder to run as the 'root'   user on POSIX platforms. 
3124,279,https://github.com/petems/puppet-splunk,### Setup Requirements,3,petems.puppet-splunk.md,3," To begin using this module, use the Puppet Module Tool (PMT) from the command line to install this module:  `puppet module install puppet-splunk`  This will place the module into your primary module path if you do not utilize the --target-dir directive.  You can also use r10k or code-manager to deploy the module so ensure that you have the correct entry in your Puppetfile.  Once the module is in place, there is just a little setup needed.  First, you will need to place your downloaded splunk installers into the files directory, `<module_path>/splunk/files/`. If you're using r10k or code-manager you'll need to override the `splunk::params::src_root` parameter to point at a modulepath outside of the Splunk module because each deploy will overwrite the files.  The files must be placed according to directory structure example given below.  The expected directory structure is:        `-- files           |-- splunk           |   `-- $platform           |       `-- splunk-${version}-${build}-${additl}           `-- universalforwarder               `-- $platform                   `-- splunkforwarder-${version}-${build}-${additl}  A semi-populated example files directory might then contain:        `-- files           |-- splunk           |   `-- linux           |       |-- splunk-6.3.3-f44afce176d0-linux-2.6-amd64.deb           |       |-- splunk-6.3.3-f44afce176d0-linux-2.6-intel.deb           |       `-- splunk-6.3.3-f44afce176d0-linux-2.6-x86_64.rpm           `-- universalforwarder               |-- linux               |   |-- splunkforwarder-6.3.3-f44afce176d0-linux-2.6-amd64.deb               |   |-- splunkforwarder-6.3.3-f44afce176d0-linux-2.6-intel.deb               |   `-- splunkforwarder-6.3.3-f44afce176d0-linux-2.6-x86_64.rpm               |-- solaris               |   `-- splunkforwarder-6.3.3-f44afce176d0-solaris-9-intel.pkg               `-- windows                   |-- splunkforwarder-6.3.3-f44afce176d0-x64-release.msi                   `-- splunkforwarder-6.3.3-f44afce176d0-x86-release.msi  Second, you will need to supply the `splunk::params` class with three critical pieces of information.  * The version of Splunk you are using * The build of Splunk you are using * The root URL to use to retrieve the packages  In the example given above, the version is 6.3.3, the build is f44afce176d0, and the root URL is puppet:///modules/splunk. See the splunk::params class documentation for more information. "
3125,279,https://github.com/petems/puppet-splunk,### Beginning with splunk,3,petems.puppet-splunk.md,3, Once the Splunk packages are hosted in the users repository or hosted by the Puppet Server in the modulepath the module is ready to deploy. 
3126,279,https://github.com/petems/puppet-splunk,## Usage,3,petems.puppet-splunk.md,2," If a user is installing Splunk with packages provided from their modulepath, this is the most basic way of installing Splunk Server with default settings:  ```puppet include ::splunk ```  This is the most basic way of installing the Splunk Universal Forwarder with default settings:  ```puppet class { '::splunk::params':     server => $my_splunk_server, }  include ::splunk::forwarder ```  Once both Splunk and Splunk Universal Forwarder have been deployed on their respective nodes, the Forwarder is ready to start sending logs.  In order to start sending some log data, users can take advantage of the `Splunkforwarder_input` type. Here is a basic example of adding an input to start sending Puppet Server logs:  ```puppet @splunkforwarder_input { 'puppetserver-sourcetype':   section => 'monitor:///var/log/puppetlabs/puppetserver/puppetserver.log',   setting => 'sourcetype',   value   => 'puppetserver',   tag     => 'splunk_forwarder' } ```  This virtual resource will get collected by the `::splunk::forwarder` class if it is tagged with `splunk_forwarder` and will add the appropriate setting to the inputs.conf file and refresh the service.

Specifying a single string as the title without a forward slash implies that the title is the section to be managed (if the section attribute is not defined).  You can also specify the resource title as `section/setting` and ommit both `section` and `setting` params for a more shortform way of declaring the resource.   Eg:  ```puppet splunkforwarder_output { 'useless title':   section => 'default',   setting => 'defaultGroup',   value   => 'splunk_9777', }  splunkforwarder_output { 'default':   setting => 'defaultGroup',   value   => 'splunk_9777', }  splunkforwarder_output { 'default/defaultGroup':   value   => 'splunk_9777', } ```  The above resource declarations will all configure the following entry in `outputs.conf`  ``` [default] defaultGroup=splunk_9997 ```  Note: if the section contains forward slashes you should not use it as the resource title and should explicitly declare it with the `section` attribute.

3184,281,https://github.com/savethefails/gcloud-node,## Authentication,3,savethefails.gcloud-node.md,2, With `gcloud-node` it's incredibly easy to get authenticated and start using Google's APIs. You can set your credentials on a global basis as well as on a per-API basis. See each individual API section below to see how you can auth on a per-API-basis. This is useful if you want to use different accounts for different Google Cloud services.

You just need to make sure that when you [set up the GCE instance][gce-how-to], you add the correct scopes for the APIs you want to access.  ``` js // Authenticating on a global basis. var projectId = process.env.GCLOUD_PROJECT_ID; // E.g. 'grape-spaceship-123' var gcloud = require('gcloud')({   projectId: projectId });  // ...you're good to go! See the next section to get started using the APIs. ``` "
3186,281,https://github.com/savethefails/gcloud-node,### Elsewhere,3,savethefails.gcloud-node.md,3," If you are not running this client on Google Compute Engine, you need a Google Developers service account. To create a service account:  1. Visit the [Google Developers Console][dev-console]. 2. Create a new project or click on an existing project. 3. Navigate to  **APIs & auth** > **APIs section** and turn on the following APIs (you may need to enable billing in order to use these services):   * Google Cloud Datastore API   * Google Cloud Storage   * Google Cloud Storage JSON API 4. Navigate to **APIs & auth** >  **Credentials** and then:   * If you want to use a new service account, click on **Create new Client ID** and select **Service account**. After the account is created, you will be prompted to download the JSON key file that the library uses to authenticate your requests.   * If you want to generate a new key for an existing service account, click on **Generate new JSON key** and download the JSON key file.  ``` js // Authenticating on a global basis. var projectId = process.env.GCLOUD_PROJECT_ID; // E.g.

You've already explored feature extraction with AlexNet and TensorFlow. Next, you will use Keras to explore feature extraction with the VGG, Inception and ResNet architectures. The models you will use were trained for days or weeks on the [ImageNet dataset](http://www.image-net.org/). Thus, the weights encapsulate higher-level features learned from training on thousands of classes.  We'll use two datasets in this lab:  1. German Traffic Sign Dataset 2. Cifar10  Unless you have a powerful GPU, running feature extraction on these models will take a significant amount of time. To make things we precomputed **bottleneck features** for each (network, dataset) pair, this will allow you experiment with feature extraction even on a modest CPU. You can think of bottleneck features as feature extraction but with caching.  Because the base network weights are frozen during feature extraction, the output for an image will always be the same. Thus, once the image has already been passed once through the network we can cache and reuse the output.  The files are encoded as such:  - {network}_{dataset}_bottleneck_features_train.p - {network}_{dataset}_bottleneck_features_validation.p  network can be one of 'vgg', 'inception', or 'resnet'  dataset can be on of 'cifar10' or 'traffic'  How will the pretrained model perform on the new datasets?"

This convention might lead developers to wrongly think that a change won't count as breaking, or that tests aren't needed. tl;dr: if you want something to be “private”, it must not be observably present.      ```javascript     // bad     this.__firstName__ = 'Panda';     this.firstName_ = 'Panda';     this._firstName = 'Panda';      // good     this.firstName = 'Panda';     ```    <a name=""naming--self-this""></a><a name=""22.5""></a>   - [23.5](#naming--self-this) Don't save references to `this`.

[`tape`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tape) is also used occasionally for small, separate modules.    - 100% test coverage is a good goal to strive for, even if it's not always practical to reach it.    - Whenever you fix a bug, _write a regression test_.

3286,287,https://github.com/FleetCarma/embedC-Challenge,# embedC-Challenge,1,FleetCarma.embedC-Challenge.md,1," The following problem is a (heavily simplified) version of a feature implemented in our vehicle telematics devices.  A vehicle telematics device needs to read a set of signals over a period of time and compile a ""trip event summary"". For an electric vehicle, this summary may include:  * Trip Start Time [seconds since unix epoch] * Trip Duration [seconds] * Trip Distance Travelled [meters] * Trip Total Energy Consumed [Watt-hours] * Trip Starting Battery State-of-Charge (SOC) Value [%] * Trip Ending Battery State-of-Charge (SOC) Value [%]  Someone has already written the code to retrieve signals from the vehicle and make each one available as a ```vehicle_signal_t```. This data structure contains the signal type, the time when the signal was received, and the signal value.  ```javascript typedef enum {     VEHICLE_SIGNAL_TYPE_VEHICLE_SPEED,		// unsigned vehicle speed in kilometers per hour     VEHICLE_SIGNAL_TYPE_HV_BATTERY_VOLTAGE,	// unsigned battery voltage in volts     VEHICLE_SIGNAL_TYPE_HV_BATTERY_CURRENT,	// signed battery current in amps     VEHICLE_SIGNAL_TYPE_HV_BATTERY_SOC		// unsigned battery state of charge in percent }vehicle_signal_type_t;  typedef struct {     vehicle_signal_type_t signal_type;     uint64_t unix_timestamp_milliseconds;     float value; }vehicle_signal_t; ```  Your job is to write a small code library, in C, to receive each signal and maintain the following trip event summary:  ```javascript typedef struct {     uint32_t start_time_since_unix_epoch_seconds;     uint32_t duration_seconds;     uint32_t distance_travelled_meters;     uint32_t total_energy_consumed_wh;     float starting_soc;     float ending_soc; }trip_event_summary_t; ``` "
3287,287,https://github.com/FleetCarma/embedC-Challenge,"# Specifically, you must:",3,FleetCarma.embedC-Challenge.md,1," 1) Create a code library containing one or more functions that receive a ```vehicle_signal_t``` and update the appropriate fields of a ```trip_event_summary_t```. 	* the start time is the time that the first signal of any type is received 	* the duration is the difference in time between the first signal (of any type) received and the last signal (of any type) received 	* the distance travelled is the numerical integration of the VEHICLE_SIGNAL_TYPE_VEHICLE_SPEED signal 	* the total energy consumed is the numerical integration of the product of VEHICLE_SIGNAL_TYPE_HV_BATTERY_VOLTAGE and VEHICLE_SIGNAL_TYPE_HV_BATTERY_CURRENT 	* the starting SOC is the first VEHICLE_SIGNAL_TYPE_HV_BATTERY_SOC signal received 	* the ending SOC is the last VEHICLE_SIGNAL_TYPE_HV_BATTERY_SOC signal received  2) Write (at least one) unit test that feeds your library a set of ```vehicle_signal_t``` and checks that the resulting ```trip_event_summary_t``` is correct. 	* The included CSV file contains data from one of our employee's vehicles. Use this data to generate a set of vehicle_signal_t for your unit test(s). 	* A good unit test asserts a result that was derived from an independent source. Document how you determined the ""correct value"" for each field in trip_event_summary_t. 	* Note that VEHICLE_SIGNAL_TYPE_HV_BATTERY_CURRENT is signed. An electric vehicle generally discharges the battery (positive current) when driving, but can also charge the battery via regenerative braking (negative current) during deceleration. The total energy to be computed is the NET POSITIVE energy drawn from the battery. "
3288,287,https://github.com/FleetCarma/embedC-Challenge,# What you'll find to get started:,3,FleetCarma.embedC-Challenge.md,1, * Two (essentially empty) source files are found in the trip_calculator directory. Use them to use to implement your library.  * A main.c exists for you to call your unit test(s). If you have a favourite C unit test library then by all means import it.  * vehicle_signal_t.h can be included where knowledge of this data type is needed.  * A CSV file with sample data should be used as the basis for your unit test(s). 
3289,287,https://github.com/FleetCarma/embedC-Challenge,# Things to keep in mind:,3,FleetCarma.embedC-Challenge.md,1," * There isn't a lot of code to get you started. In fact, the included files are missing some important elements. Please demonstrate best practices when updating these files.  * We don't care what integration method you choose to use.  * Use comments to describe what your code does (and, more importantly, why).  * Feel free to add more source files if you feel that they will benefit the project.  * You may create new types and variables as needed to support your calculations. Try to keep your code library file(s) from containing any state, so that they are safe to use in a multi-threaded environment.  * Although you will likely test your code in a desktop environment, it will ultimately execute in an embedded environment (a low-cost 32-bit micro-controller). Be aware of this when choosing the data types and mathematical operations for your calculations."

3309,290,https://github.com/CASunday2003/jquery,## Contribution Guides,7,CASunday2003.jquery.md,2,"--------------------------------------  In the spirit of open source software development, jQuery always encourages community code contribution. To help you get started and before you jump into writing code, be sure to read these important contribution guidelines thoroughly:  1. [Getting Involved](https://contribute.jquery.org/) 2. [Core Style Guide](https://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/) 3. [Writing Code for jQuery Foundation Projects](https://contribute.jquery.org/code/)  "
3310,290,https://github.com/CASunday2003/jquery,## Environments in which to use jQuery,3,CASunday2003.jquery.md,2,"--------------------------------------  - [Browser support](https://jquery.com/browser-support/) - jQuery also supports Node, browser extensions, and other non-browser environments.  "
3311,290,https://github.com/CASunday2003/jquery,## What you need to build your own jQuery,3,CASunday2003.jquery.md,2,"--------------------------------------  In order to build jQuery, you need to have the latest Node.js/npm and git 1.7 or later. Earlier versions might work, but are not supported.  For Windows, you have to download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).  OS X users should install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). Once Homebrew is installed, run `brew install git` to install git, and `brew install node` to install Node.js.  Linux/BSD users should use their appropriate package managers to install git and Node.js, or build from source if you swing that way. Easy-peasy.  "
3312,290,https://github.com/CASunday2003/jquery,## How to build your own jQuery,3,CASunday2003.jquery.md,2,"----------------------------  Clone a copy of the main jQuery git repo by running:  ```bash git clone git://github.com/jquery/jquery.git ```  Enter the jquery directory and run the build script: ```bash cd jquery && npm run build ``` The built version of jQuery will be put in the `dist/` subdirectory, along with the minified copy and associated map file.  If you want to create custom build or help with jQuery development, it would be better to install [grunt command line interface](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli) as a global package:  ``` npm install -g grunt-cli ``` Make sure you have `grunt` installed by testing: ``` grunt -V ```  Now by running the `grunt` command, in the jquery directory, you can build a full version of jQuery, just like with an `npm run build` command: ``` grunt ```  There are many other tasks available for jQuery Core: ``` grunt -help ``` "
3313,290,https://github.com/CASunday2003/jquery,### Modules,3,CASunday2003.jquery.md,3," Special builds can be created that exclude subsets of jQuery functionality. This allows for smaller custom builds when the builder is certain that those parts of jQuery are not being used. For example, an app that only used JSONP for `$.ajax()` and did not need to calculate offsets or positions of elements could exclude the offset and ajax/xhr modules.  Any module may be excluded except for `core`, and `selector`. To exclude a module, pass its path relative to the `src` folder (without the `.js` extension).  Some example modules that can be excluded are:  - **ajax**: All AJAX functionality: `$.ajax()`, `$.get()`, `$.post()`, `$.ajaxSetup()`, `.load()`, transports, and ajax event shorthands such as `.ajaxStart()`. - **ajax/xhr**: The XMLHTTPRequest AJAX transport only. - **ajax/script**: The `<script>` AJAX transport only; used to retrieve scripts. - **ajax/jsonp**: The JSONP AJAX transport only; depends on the ajax/script transport. - **css**: The `.css()` method. Also removes **all** modules depending on css (including **effects**, **dimensions**, and **offset**). - **css/showHide**:  Non-animated `.show()`, `.hide()` and `.toggle()`; can be excluded if you use classes or explicit `.css()` calls to set the `display` property. Also removes the **effects** module. - **deprecated**: Methods documented as deprecated but not yet removed. - **dimensions**: The `.width()` and `.height()` methods, including `inner-` and `outer-` variations. - **effects**: The `.animate()` method and its shorthands such as `.slideUp()` or `.hide(""slow"")`. - **event**: The `.on()` and `.off()` methods and all event functionality. Also removes `event/alias`. - **event/alias**: All event attaching/triggering shorthands like `.click()` or `.mouseover()`. - **event/focusin**: Cross-browser support for the focusin and focusout events. - **event/trigger**: The `.trigger()` and `.triggerHandler()` methods. Used by **alias** and **focusin** modules. - **offset**: The `.offset()`, `.position()`, `.offsetParent()`, `.scrollLeft()`, and `.scrollTop()` methods. - **wrap**: The `.wrap()`, `.wrapAll()`, `.wrapInner()`, and `.unwrap()` methods. - **core/ready**: Exclude the ready module if you place your scripts at the end of the body. Any ready callbacks bound with `jQuery()` will simply be called immediately. However, `jQuery(document).ready()` will not be a function and `.on(""ready"", ...)` or similar will not be triggered. - **deferred**: Exclude jQuery.Deferred. This also removes jQuery.Callbacks. *Note* that modules that depend on jQuery.Deferred(AJAX, effects, core/ready) will not be removed and will still expect jQuery.Deferred to be there. Include your own jQuery.Deferred implementation or exclude those modules as well (`grunt custom:-deferred,-ajax,-effects,-core/ready`). - **exports/global**: Exclude the attachment of global jQuery variables ($ and jQuery) to the window. - **exports/amd**: Exclude the AMD definition.  As a special case, you may also replace Sizzle by using a special flag `grunt custom:-sizzle`.  - **sizzle**: The Sizzle selector engine. When this module is excluded, it is replaced by a rudimentary selector engine based on the browser's `querySelectorAll` method that does not support jQuery selector extensions or enhanced semantics. See the [selector-native.js](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/selector-native.js) file for details.  *Note*: Excluding Sizzle will also exclude all jQuery selector extensions (such as `effects/animatedSelector` and `css/hiddenVisibleSelectors`).  The build process shows a message for each dependent module it excludes or includes. "
3314,290,https://github.com/CASunday2003/jquery,##### AMD name,3,CASunday2003.jquery.md,5," As an option, you can set the module name for jQuery's AMD definition. By default, it is set to ""jquery"", which plays nicely with plugins and third-party libraries, but there may be cases where you'd like to change this. Simply set the `""amd""` option:  ```bash grunt custom --amd=""custom-name"" ```  Or, to define anonymously, set the name to an empty string.  ```bash grunt custom --amd="""" ``` "
3315,290,https://github.com/CASunday2003/jquery,#### Custom Build Examples,3,CASunday2003.jquery.md,4," To create a custom build, first check out the version:  ```bash git pull; git checkout VERSION ```  Where VERSION is the version you want to customize. Then, make sure all Node dependencies are installed:  ```bash npm install ```  Create the custom build using the `grunt custom` option, listing the modules to be excluded.  Exclude all **ajax** functionality:  ```bash grunt custom:-ajax ```  Excluding **css** removes modules depending on CSS: **effects**, **offset**, **dimensions**.  ```bash grunt custom:-css ```  Exclude a bunch of modules:  ```bash grunt custom:-ajax,-css,-deprecated,-dimensions,-effects,-event/alias,-offset,-wrap ```  For questions or requests regarding custom builds, please start a thread on the [Developing jQuery Core](https://forum.jquery.com/developing-jquery-core) section of the forum. Due to the combinatorics and custom nature of these builds, they are not regularly tested in jQuery's unit test process. The non-Sizzle selector engine currently does not pass unit tests because it is missing too much essential functionality. "
3316,290,https://github.com/CASunday2003/jquery,## Running the Unit Tests,3,CASunday2003.jquery.md,2,"--------------------------------------  Make sure you have the necessary dependencies:  ```bash npm install ```  Start `grunt watch` or `npm start` to auto-build jQuery as you work:  ```bash grunt watch ```   Run the unit tests with a local server that supports PHP. Ensure that you run the site from the root directory, not the ""test"" directory. No database is required. Pre-configured php local servers are available for Windows and Mac. Here are some options:  - Windows: [WAMP download](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) - Mac: [MAMP download](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/) - Linux: [Setting up LAMP](https://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/288158-easy-lamp-server-installation) - [Mongoose (most platforms)](https://code.google.com/p/mongoose/)    "
3317,290,https://github.com/CASunday2003/jquery,## Building to a different directory,3,CASunday2003.jquery.md,2,"---------------------------------  To copy the built jQuery files from `/dist` to another directory:  ```bash grunt && grunt dist:/path/to/special/location/ ``` With this example, the output files would be:  ```bash /path/to/special/location/jquery.js /path/to/special/location/jquery.min.js ```  To add a permanent copy destination, create a file in `dist/` called "".destination.json"". Inside the file, paste and customize the following:  ```json  {   ""/Absolute/path/to/other/destination"": true } ```  Additionally, both methods can be combined.   "

3320,290,https://github.com/CASunday2003/jquery,### Rebasing ###,3,CASunday2003.jquery.md,3," For feature/topic branches, you should always use the `--rebase` flag to `git pull`, or if you are usually handling many temporary ""to be in a github pull request"" branches, run the following to automate this:  ```bash git config branch.autosetuprebase local ``` (see `man git-config` for more information) "
3321,290,https://github.com/CASunday2003/jquery,### Handling merge conflicts ###,3,CASunday2003.jquery.md,3," If you're getting merge conflicts when merging, instead of editing the conflicted files manually, you can use the feature `git mergetool`. Even though the default tool `xxdiff` looks awful/old, it's rather useful.  The following are some commands that can be used there:  * `Ctrl + Alt + M` - automerge as much as possible * `b` - jump to next merge conflict * `s` - change the order of the conflicted lines * `u` - undo a merge * `left mouse button` - mark a block to be the winner * `middle mouse button` - mark a line to be the winner * `Ctrl + S` - save * `Ctrl + Q` - quit "

3330,290,https://github.com/CASunday2003/jquery,### Run tests in an iframe ###,36,CASunday2003.jquery.md,3," Some tests may require a document other than the standard test fixture, and these can be run in a separate iframe. The actual test code and assertions remain in jQuery's main test files; only the minimal test fixture markup and setup code should be placed in the iframe file.  ```js testIframe( testName, fileName,   function testCallback(       assert, jQuery, window, document, 	  [ additional args ] ) { 	...   } ); ```  This loads a page, constructing a url with fileName `""./data/"" + fileName`. The iframed page determines when the callback occurs in the test by including the ""/test/data/iframeTest.js"" script and calling `startIframeTest( [ additional args ] )` when appropriate. Often this will be after either document ready or `window.onload` fires.  The `testCallback` receives the QUnit `assert` object created by `testIframe` for this test, followed by the global `jQuery`, `window`, and `document` from the iframe. If the iframe code passes any arguments to `startIframeTest`, they follow the `document` argument.  "

3363,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,## Updating to New Releases,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,2," Create React App is divided into two packages:  * `create-react-app` is a global command-line utility that you use to create new projects. * `react-scripts` is a development dependency in the generated projects (including this one).  You almost never need to update `create-react-app` itself: it delegates all the setup to `react-scripts`.  When you run `create-react-app`, it always creates the project with the latest version of `react-scripts` so you’ll get all the new features and improvements in newly created apps automatically.  To update an existing project to a new version of `react-scripts`, [open the changelog](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), find the version you’re currently on (check `package.json` in this folder if you’re not sure), and apply the migration instructions for the newer versions.  In most cases bumping the `react-scripts` version in `package.json` and running `npm install` in this folder should be enough, but it’s good to consult the [changelog](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for potential breaking changes.  We commit to keeping the breaking changes minimal so you can upgrade `react-scripts` painlessly. "

3365,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,## Folder Structure,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,2," After creation, your project should look like this:  ``` my-app/   README.md   node_modules/   package.json   public/     index.html     favicon.ico   src/     App.css     App.js     App.test.js     index.css     index.js     logo.svg ```  For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:  * `public/index.html` is the page template; * `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.  You can delete or rename the other files.  You may create subdirectories inside `src`. For faster rebuilds, only files inside `src` are processed by Webpack.<br> You need to **put any JS and CSS files inside `src`**, or Webpack won’t see them.  Only files inside `public` can be used from `public/index.html`.<br> Read instructions below for using assets from JavaScript and HTML.  You can, however, create more top-level directories.<br> They will not be included in the production build so you can use them for things like documentation. "

This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.  Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.  You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it. "

Learn more about [different proposal stages](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/#presets-stage-x-experimental-presets-).  While we recommend to use experimental proposals with some caution, Facebook heavily uses these features in the product code, so we intend to provide [codemods](https://medium.com/@cpojer/effective-javascript-codemods-5a6686bb46fb) if any of these proposals change in the future.  Note that **the project only includes a few ES6 [polyfills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill)**:  * [`Object.assign()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign) via [`object-assign`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/object-assign). * [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) via [`promise`](https://github.com/then/promise). * [`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) via [`whatwg-fetch`](https://github.com/github/fetch).  If you use any other ES6+ features that need **runtime support** (such as `Array.from()` or `Symbol`), make sure you are including the appropriate polyfills manually, or that the browsers you are targeting already support them.

3373,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,## Displaying Lint Output in the Editor,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,2," >Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.0` and higher.  Some editors, including Sublime Text, Atom, and Visual Studio Code, provide plugins for ESLint.  They are not required for linting. You should see the linter output right in your terminal as well as the browser console. However, if you prefer the lint results to appear right in your editor, there are some extra steps you can do.  You would need to install an ESLint plugin for your editor first.  >**A note for Atom `linter-eslint` users**  >If you are using the Atom `linter-eslint` plugin, make sure that **Use global ESLint installation** option is checked:  ><img src=""http://i.imgur.com/yVNNHJM.png"" width=""300"">   >**For Visual Studio Code users**  >VS Code ESLint plugin automatically detects Create React App's configuration file. So you do not need to create `eslintrc.json` at the root directory, except when you want to add your own rules. In that case, you should include CRA's config by adding this line:  >```js {   // ...   ""extends"": ""react-app"" } ```  Then add this block to the `package.json` file of your project:  ```js {   // ...   ""eslintConfig"": {     ""extends"": ""react-app""   } } ```  Finally, you will need to install some packages *globally*:  ```sh npm install -g eslint-config-react-app@0.3.0 eslint@3.8.1 babel-eslint@7.0.0 eslint-plugin-react@6.4.1 eslint-plugin-import@2.0.1 eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y@4.0.0 eslint-plugin-flowtype@2.21.0 ```  We recognize that this is suboptimal, but it is currently required due to the way we hide the ESLint dependency. The ESLint team is already [working on a solution to this](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/3458) so this may become unnecessary in a couple of months. "
3374,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,## Debugging in the Editor,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,2," **This feature is currently only supported by [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) editor.**  Visual Studio Code supports live-editing and debugging out of the box with Create React App. This enables you as a developer to write and debug your React code without leaving the editor, and most importantly it enables you to have a continuous development workflow, where context switching is minimal, as you don’t have to switch between tools.  You would need to have the latest version of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and VS Code [Chrome Debugger Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) installed.  Then add the block below to your `launch.json` file and put it inside the `.vscode` folder in your app’s root directory.  ```json {   ""version"": ""0.2.0"",   ""configurations"": [{     ""name"": ""Chrome"",     ""type"": ""chrome"",     ""request"": ""launch"",     ""url"": ""http://localhost:3000"",     ""webRoot"": ""${workspaceRoot}/src"",     ""userDataDir"": ""${workspaceRoot}/.vscode/chrome"",     ""sourceMapPathOverrides"": {       ""webpack:///src/*"": ""${webRoot}/*""     }   }] } ```  Start your app by running `npm start`, and start debugging in VS Code by pressing `F5` or by clicking the green debug icon. You can now write code, set breakpoints, make changes to the code, and debug your newly modified code—all from your editor. "
3375,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,## Changing the Page `<title>`,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,2," You can find the source HTML file in the `public` folder of the generated project. You may edit the `<title>` tag in it to change the title from “React App” to anything else.  Note that normally you wouldn’t edit files in the `public` folder very often. For example, [adding a stylesheet](#adding-a-stylesheet) is done without touching the HTML.  If you need to dynamically update the page title based on the content, you can use the browser [`document.title`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/title) API. For more complex scenarios when you want to change the title from React components, you can use [React Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet), a third party library.  If you use a custom server for your app in production and want to modify the title before it gets sent to the browser, you can follow advice in [this section](#generating-dynamic-meta-tags-on-the-server). Alternatively, you can pre-build each page as a static HTML file which then loads the JavaScript bundle, which is covered [here](#pre-rendering-into-static-html-files). "
3376,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,## Installing a Dependency,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,2," The generated project includes React and ReactDOM as dependencies. It also includes a set of scripts used by Create React App as a development dependency.

3377,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,## Importing a Component,36,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,2," This project setup supports ES6 modules thanks to Babel.<br> While you can still use `require()` and `module.exports`, we encourage you to use [`import` and `export`](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html) instead.  For example: "
3378,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,### `Button.js`,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,3," ```js import React, { Component } from 'react';  class Button extends Component {   render() {     // ...   } }  export default Button; // Don’t forget to use export default! ``` "

It is a common source of mistakes.  We suggest that you stick to using default imports and exports when a module only exports a single thing (for example, a component). That’s what you get when you use `export default Button` and `import Button from './Button'`.  Named exports are useful for utility modules that export several functions. A module may have at most one default export and as many named exports as you like.

3380,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,## Adding a Stylesheet,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,2," This project setup uses [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) for handling all assets. Webpack offers a custom way of “extending” the concept of `import` beyond JavaScript. To express that a JavaScript file depends on a CSS file, you need to **import the CSS from the JavaScript file**: "
3381,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,### `Button.css`,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,3, ```css .Button {   padding: 20px; } ``` 
3382,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,### `Button.js`,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,3," ```js import React, { Component } from 'react'; import './Button.css'; // Tell Webpack that Button.js uses these styles  class Button extends Component {   render() {     // You can use them as regular CSS styles     return <div className=""Button"" />;   } } ```  **This is not required for React** but many people find this feature convenient. You can read about the benefits of this approach [here](https://medium.com/seek-ui-engineering/block-element-modifying-your-javascript-components-d7f99fcab52b). However you should be aware that this makes your code less portable to other build tools and environments than Webpack.  In development, expressing dependencies this way allows your styles to be reloaded on the fly as you edit them. In production, all CSS files will be concatenated into a single minified `.css` file in the build output.  If you are concerned about using Webpack-specific semantics, you can put all your CSS right into `src/index.css`. It would still be imported from `src/index.js`, but you could always remove that import if you later migrate to a different build tool. "
3383,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,## Post-Processing CSS,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,2," This project setup minifies your CSS and adds vendor prefixes to it automatically through [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) so you don’t need to worry about it.  For example, this:  ```css .App {   display: flex;   flex-direction: row;   align-items: center; } ```  becomes this:  ```css .App {   display: -webkit-box;   display: -ms-flexbox;   display: flex;   -webkit-box-orient: horizontal;   -webkit-box-direction: normal;       -ms-flex-direction: row;           flex-direction: row;   -webkit-box-align: center;       -ms-flex-align: center;           align-items: center; } ```  If you need to disable autoprefixing for some reason, [follow this section](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer#disabling). "
3384,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,"## Adding a CSS Preprocessor (Sass, Less etc.)",3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,2," Generally, we recommend that you don’t reuse the same CSS classes across different components. For example, instead of using a `.Button` CSS class in `<AcceptButton>` and `<RejectButton>` components, we recommend creating a `<Button>` component with its own `.Button` styles, that both `<AcceptButton>` and `<RejectButton>` can render (but [not inherit](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html)).  Following this rule often makes CSS preprocessors less useful, as features like mixins and nesting are replaced by component composition. You can, however, integrate a CSS preprocessor if you find it valuable. In this walkthrough, we will be using Sass, but you can also use Less, or another alternative.  First, let’s install the command-line interface for Sass:  ``` npm install node-sass --save-dev ```  Then in `package.json`, add the following lines to `scripts`:  ```diff    ""scripts"": { +    ""build-css"": ""node-sass src/ -o src/"", +    ""watch-css"": ""npm run build-css && node-sass src/ -o src/ --watch --recursive"",      ""start"": ""react-scripts start"",      ""build"": ""react-scripts build"",      ""test"": ""react-scripts test --env=jsdom"", ```  >Note: To use a different preprocessor, replace `build-css` and `watch-css` commands according to your preprocessor’s documentation.  Now you can rename `src/App.css` to `src/App.scss` and run `npm run watch-css`. The watcher will find every Sass file in `src` subdirectories, and create a corresponding CSS file next to it, in our case overwriting `src/App.css`. Since `src/App.js` still imports `src/App.css`, the styles become a part of your application. You can now edit `src/App.scss`, and `src/App.css` will be regenerated.  To share variables between Sass files, you can use Sass imports. For example, `src/App.scss` and other component style files could include `@import ""./shared.scss"";` with variable definitions.  At this point you might want to remove all CSS files from the source control, and add `src/**/*.css` to your `.gitignore` file. It is generally a good practice to keep the build products outside of the source control.  As a final step, you may find it convenient to run `watch-css` automatically with `npm start`, and run `build-css` as a part of `npm run build`. You can use the `&&` operator to execute two scripts sequentially. However, there is no cross-platform way to run two scripts in parallel, so we will install a package for this:  ``` npm install --save-dev npm-run-all ```  Then we can change `start` and `build` scripts to include the CSS preprocessor commands:  ```diff    ""scripts"": {      ""build-css"": ""node-sass src/ -o src/"",      ""watch-css"": ""npm run build-css && node-sass src/ -o src/ --watch --recursive"", -    ""start"": ""react-scripts start"", -    ""build"": ""react-scripts build"", +    ""start-js"": ""react-scripts start"", +    ""start"": ""npm-run-all -p watch-css start-js"", +    ""build"": ""npm run build-css && react-scripts build"",      ""test"": ""react-scripts test --env=jsdom"",      ""eject"": ""react-scripts eject""    } ```  Now running `npm start` and `npm run build` also builds Sass files. Note that `node-sass` seems to have an [issue recognizing newly created files on some systems](https://github.com/sass/node-sass/issues/1891) so you might need to restart the watcher when you create a file until it’s resolved. "
3385,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,## Adding Images and Fonts,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,2," With Webpack, using static assets like images and fonts works similarly to CSS.  You can **`import` an image right in a JavaScript module**. This tells Webpack to include that image in the bundle. Unlike CSS imports, importing an image or a font gives you a string value. This value is the final image path you can reference in your code.  Here is an example:  ```js import React from 'react'; import logo from './logo.png'; // Tell Webpack this JS file uses this image  console.log(logo); // /logo.84287d09.png  function Header() {   // Import result is the URL of your image   return <img src={logo} alt=""Logo"" />; }  export default Header; ```  This ensures that when the project is built, Webpack will correctly move the images into the build folder, and provide us with correct paths.  This works in CSS too:  ```css .Logo {   background-image: url(./logo.png); } ```  Webpack finds all relative module references in CSS (they start with `./`) and replaces them with the final paths from the compiled bundle. If you make a typo or accidentally delete an important file, you will see a compilation error, just like when you import a non-existent JavaScript module. The final filenames in the compiled bundle are generated by Webpack from content hashes. If the file content changes in the future, Webpack will give it a different name in production so you don’t need to worry about long-term caching of assets.  Please be advised that this is also a custom feature of Webpack.  **It is not required for React** but many people enjoy it (and React Native uses a similar mechanism for images).<br> An alternative way of handling static assets is described in the next section.

This mechanism provides a number of benefits:  * Scripts and stylesheets get minified and bundled together to avoid extra network requests. * Missing files cause compilation errors instead of 404 errors for your users. * Result filenames include content hashes so you don’t need to worry about browsers caching their old versions.  However there is an **escape hatch** that you can use to add an asset outside of the module system.  If you put a file into the `public` folder, it will **not** be processed by Webpack. Instead it will be copied into the build folder untouched.   To reference assets in the `public` folder, you need to use a special variable called `PUBLIC_URL`.  Inside `index.html`, you can use it like this:  ```html <link rel=""shortcut icon"" href=""%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico""> ```  Only files inside the `public` folder will be accessible by `%PUBLIC_URL%` prefix. If you need to use a file from `src` or `node_modules`, you’ll have to copy it there to explicitly specify your intention to make this file a part of the build.  When you run `npm run build`, Create React App will substitute `%PUBLIC_URL%` with a correct absolute path so your project works even if you use client-side routing or host it at a non-root URL.  In JavaScript code, you can use `process.env.PUBLIC_URL` for similar purposes:  ```js render() {   // Note: this is an escape hatch and should be used sparingly!   // Normally we recommend using `import` for getting asset URLs   // as described in “Adding Images and Fonts” above this section.   return <img src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + '/img/logo.png'} />; } ```  Keep in mind the downsides of this approach:  * None of the files in `public` folder get post-processed or minified. * Missing files will not be called at compilation time, and will cause 404 errors for your users. * Result filenames won’t include content hashes so you’ll need to add query arguments or rename them every time they change. "
3389,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,### When to Use the `public` Folder,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,3," Normally we recommend importing [stylesheets](#adding-a-stylesheet), [images, and fonts](#adding-images-and-fonts) from JavaScript. The `public` folder is useful as a workaround for a number of less common cases:  * You need a file with a specific name in the build output, such as [`manifest.webmanifest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest). * You have thousands of images and need to dynamically reference their paths. * You want to include a small script like [`pace.js`](http://github.hubspot.com/pace/docs/welcome/) outside of the bundled code. * Some library may be incompatible with Webpack and you have no other option but to include it as a `<script>` tag.  Note that if you add a `<script>` that declares global variables, you also need to read the next section on using them. "
3390,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,## Using Global Variables,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,2," When you include a script in the HTML file that defines global variables and try to use one of these variables in the code, the linter will complain because it cannot see the definition of the variable.  You can avoid this by reading the global variable explicitly from the `window` object, for example:  ```js const $ = window.$; ```  This makes it obvious you are using a global variable intentionally rather than because of a typo.  Alternatively, you can force the linter to ignore any line by adding `// eslint-disable-line` after it. "
3391,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,## Adding Bootstrap,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,2," You don’t have to use [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io) together with React but it is a popular library for integrating Bootstrap with React apps. If you need it, you can integrate it with Create React App by following these steps:  Install React Bootstrap and Bootstrap from npm. React Bootstrap does not include Bootstrap CSS so this needs to be installed as well:  ``` npm install react-bootstrap --save npm install bootstrap@3 --save ```  Import Bootstrap CSS and optionally Bootstrap theme CSS in the beginning of your ```src/index.js``` file:  ```js import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css'; import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap-theme.css'; // Put any other imports below so that CSS from your // components takes precedence over default styles. ```  Import required React Bootstrap components within ```src/App.js``` file or your custom component files:  ```js import { Navbar, Jumbotron, Button } from 'react-bootstrap'; ```  Now you are ready to use the imported React Bootstrap components within your component hierarchy defined in the render method. Here is an example [`App.js`](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/gaearon/85d8c067f6af1e56277c82d19fd4da7b/raw/6158dd991b67284e9fc8d70b9d973efe87659d72/App.js) redone using React Bootstrap. "
3392,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,### Using a Custom Theme,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,3," Sometimes you might need to tweak the visual styles of Bootstrap (or equivalent package).<br> We suggest the following approach:  * Create a new package that depends on the package you wish to customize, e.g. Bootstrap. * Add the necessary build steps to tweak the theme, and publish your package on npm. * Install your own theme npm package as a dependency of your app.  Here is an example of adding a [customized Bootstrap](https://medium.com/@tacomanator/customizing-create-react-app-aa9ffb88165) that follows these steps. "
3393,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,## Adding Flow,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,2," Flow is a static type checker that helps you write code with fewer bugs. Check out this [introduction to using static types in JavaScript](https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy/why-use-static-types-in-javascript-part-1-8382da1e0adb) if you are new to this concept.  Recent versions of [Flow](http://flowtype.org/) work with Create React App projects out of the box.  To add Flow to a Create React App project, follow these steps:  1. Run `npm install --save-dev flow-bin` (or `yarn add --dev flow-bin`). 2. Add `""flow"": ""flow""` to the `scripts` section of your `package.json`. 3. Run `npm run flow -- init` (or `yarn flow -- init`) to create a [`.flowconfig` file](https://flowtype.org/docs/advanced-configuration.html) in the root directory. 4. Add `// @flow` to any files you want to type check (for example, to `src/App.js`).  Now you can run `npm run flow` (or `yarn flow`) to check the files for type errors. You can optionally use an IDE like [Nuclide](https://nuclide.io/docs/languages/flow/) for a better integrated experience. In the future we plan to integrate it into Create React App even more closely.  To learn more about Flow, check out [its documentation](https://flowtype.org/). "
3394,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,## Adding Custom Environment Variables,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,2," >Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.3` and higher.  Your project can consume variables declared in your environment as if they were declared locally in your JS files. By default you will have `NODE_ENV` defined for you, and any other environment variables starting with `REACT_APP_`.  **The environment variables are embedded during the build time**. Since Create React App produces a static HTML/CSS/JS bundle, it can’t possibly read them at runtime. To read them at runtime, you would need to load HTML into memory on the server and replace placeholders in runtime, just like [described here](#injecting-data-from-the-server-into-the-page). Alternatively you can rebuild the app on the server anytime you change them.  >Note: You must create custom environment variables beginning with `REACT_APP_`. Any other variables except `NODE_ENV` will be ignored to avoid accidentally [exposing a private key on the machine that could have the same name](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/865#issuecomment-252199527). Changing any environment variables will require you to restart the development server if it is running.  These environment variables will be defined for you on `process.env`. For example, having an environment variable named `REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE` will be exposed in your JS as `process.env.REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE`.  There is also a special built-in environment variable called `NODE_ENV`. You can read it from `process.env.NODE_ENV`. When you run `npm start`, it is always equal to `'development'`, when you run `npm test` it is always equal to `'test'`, and when you run `npm run build` to make a production bundle, it is always equal to `'production'`. **You cannot override `NODE_ENV` manually.** This prevents developers from accidentally deploying a slow development build to production.  These environment variables can be useful for displaying information conditionally based on where the project is deployed or consuming sensitive data that lives outside of version control.  First, you need to have environment variables defined. For example, let’s say you wanted to consume a secret defined in the environment inside a `<form>`:  ```jsx render() {   return (     <div>       <small>You are running this application in <b>{process.env.NODE_ENV}</b> mode.</small>       <form>         <input type=""hidden"" defaultValue={process.env.REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE} />       </form>     </div>   ); } ```  During the build, `process.env.REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE` will be replaced with the current value of the `REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE` environment variable. Remember that the `NODE_ENV` variable will be set for you automatically.  When you load the app in the browser and inspect the `<input>`, you will see its value set to `abcdef`, and the bold text will show the environment provided when using `npm start`:  ```html <div>   <small>You are running this application in <b>development</b> mode.</small>   <form>     <input type=""hidden"" value=""abcdef"" />   </form> </div> ```  The above form is looking for a variable called `REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE` from the environment. In order to consume this value, we need to have it defined in the environment. This can be done using two ways: either in your shell or in a `.env` file. Both of these ways are described in the next few sections.  Having access to the `NODE_ENV` is also useful for performing actions conditionally:  ```js if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {   analytics.disable(); } ```  When you compile the app with `npm run build`, the minification step will strip out this condition, and the resulting bundle will be smaller.

3404,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,## Proxying API Requests in Development,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,2," >Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.3` and higher.  People often serve the front-end React app from the same host and port as their backend implementation.<br> For example, a production setup might look like this after the app is deployed:  ``` /             - static server returns index.html with React app /todos        - static server returns index.html with React app /api/todos    - server handles any /api/* requests using the backend implementation ```  Such setup is **not** required. However, if you **do** have a setup like this, it is convenient to write requests like `fetch('/api/todos')` without worrying about redirecting them to another host or port during development.  To tell the development server to proxy any unknown requests to your API server in development, add a `proxy` field to your `package.json`, for example:  ```js   ""proxy"": ""http://localhost:4000"", ```  This way, when you `fetch('/api/todos')` in development, the development server will recognize that it’s not a static asset, and will proxy your request to `http://localhost:4000/api/todos` as a fallback. The development server will only attempt to send requests without a `text/html` accept header to the proxy.  Conveniently, this avoids [CORS issues](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21854516/understanding-ajax-cors-and-security-considerations) and error messages like this in development:  ``` Fetch API cannot load http://localhost:4000/api/todos. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:3000' is therefore not allowed access. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled. ```  Keep in mind that `proxy` only has effect in development (with `npm start`), and it is up to you to ensure that URLs like `/api/todos` point to the right thing in production. You don’t have to use the `/api` prefix. Any unrecognized request without a `text/html` accept header will be redirected to the specified `proxy`.  The `proxy` option supports HTTP, HTTPS and WebSocket connections.<br> If the `proxy` option is **not** flexible enough for you, alternatively you can:  * Enable CORS on your server ([here’s how to do it for Express](http://enable-cors.org/server_expressjs.html)). * Use [environment variables](#adding-custom-environment-variables) to inject the right server host and port into your app. "

You may require the dev server to serve pages over HTTPS. One particular case where this could be useful is when using [the ""proxy"" feature](#proxying-api-requests-in-development) to proxy requests to an API server when that API server is itself serving HTTPS.  To do this, set the `HTTPS` environment variable to `true`, then start the dev server as usual with `npm start`: "

3408,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,## Generating Dynamic `<meta>` Tags on the Server,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,2," Since Create React App doesn’t support server rendering, you might be wondering how to make `<meta>` tags dynamic and reflect the current URL. To solve this, we recommend to add placeholders into the HTML, like this:  ```html <!doctype html> <html lang=""en"">   <head>     <meta property=""og:title"" content=""__OG_TITLE__"">     <meta property=""og:description"" content=""__OG_DESCRIPTION__""> ```  Then, on the server, regardless of the backend you use, you can read `index.html` into memory and replace `__OG_TITLE__`, `__OG_DESCRIPTION__`, and any other placeholders with values depending on the current URL. Just make sure to sanitize and escape the interpolated values so that they are safe to embed into HTML!  If you use a Node server, you can even share the route matching logic between the client and the server. However duplicating it also works fine in simple cases. "
3409,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,## Pre-Rendering into Static HTML Files,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,2," If you’re hosting your `build` with a static hosting provider you can use [react-snapshot](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-snapshot) to generate HTML pages for each route, or relative link, in your application. These pages will then seamlessly become active, or “hydrated”, when the JavaScript bundle has loaded.  There are also opportunities to use this outside of static hosting, to take the pressure off the server when generating and caching routes.  The primary benefit of pre-rendering is that you get the core content of each page _with_ the HTML payload—regardless of whether or not your JavaScript bundle successfully downloads. It also increases the likelihood that each route of your application will be picked up by search engines.  You can read more about [zero-configuration pre-rendering (also called snapshotting) here](https://medium.com/superhighfives/an-almost-static-stack-6df0a2791319). "
3410,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,## Injecting Data from the Server into the Page,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,2," Similarly to the previous section, you can leave some placeholders in the HTML that inject global variables, for example:  ```js <!doctype html> <html lang=""en"">   <head>     <script>       window.SERVER_DATA = __SERVER_DATA__;     </script> ```  Then, on the server, you can replace `__SERVER_DATA__` with a JSON of real data right before sending the response. The client code can then read `window.SERVER_DATA` to use it. **Make sure to [sanitize the JSON before sending it to the client](https://medium.com/node-security/the-most-common-xss-vulnerability-in-react-js-applications-2bdffbcc1fa0) as it makes your app vulnerable to XSS attacks.** "
3411,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,## Running Tests,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,2," >Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.3.0` and higher.<br> >[Read the migration guide to learn how to enable it in older projects!](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#migrating-from-023-to-030)  Create React App uses [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) as its test runner. To prepare for this integration, we did a [major revamp](https://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/09/01/jest-15.html) of Jest so if you heard bad things about it years ago, give it another try.  Jest is a Node-based runner. This means that the tests always run in a Node environment and not in a real browser. This lets us enable fast iteration speed and prevent flakiness.  While Jest provides browser globals such as `window` thanks to [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom), they are only approximations of the real browser behavior. Jest is intended to be used for unit tests of your logic and your components rather than the DOM quirks.  We recommend that you use a separate tool for browser end-to-end tests if you need them. They are beyond the scope of Create React App. "
3412,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,### Filename Conventions,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,3," Jest will look for test files with any of the following popular naming conventions:  * Files with `.js` suffix in `__tests__` folders. * Files with `.test.js` suffix. * Files with `.spec.js` suffix.  The `.test.js` / `.spec.js` files (or the `__tests__` folders) can be located at any depth under the `src` top level folder.  We recommend to put the test files (or `__tests__` folders) next to the code they are testing so that relative imports appear shorter. For example, if `App.test.js` and `App.js` are in the same folder, the test just needs to `import App from './App'` instead of a long relative path. Colocation also helps find tests more quickly in larger projects. "
3413,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,### Command Line Interface,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,3," When you run `npm test`, Jest will launch in the watch mode. Every time you save a file, it will re-run the tests, just like `npm start` recompiles the code.  The watcher includes an interactive command-line interface with the ability to run all tests, or focus on a search pattern. It is designed this way so that you can keep it open and enjoy fast re-runs. You can learn the commands from the “Watch Usage” note that the watcher prints after every run:  ![Jest watch mode](http://facebook.github.io/jest/img/blog/15-watch.gif) "
3414,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,### Version Control Integration,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,3," By default, when you run `npm test`, Jest will only run the tests related to files changed since the last commit. This is an optimization designed to make your tests runs fast regardless of how many tests you have. However it assumes that you don’t often commit the code that doesn’t pass the tests.  Jest will always explicitly mention that it only ran tests related to the files changed since the last commit. You can also press `a` in the watch mode to force Jest to run all tests.  Jest will always run all tests on a [continuous integration](#continuous-integration) server or if the project is not inside a Git or Mercurial repository. "
3415,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,### Writing Tests,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,3," To create tests, add `it()` (or `test()`) blocks with the name of the test and its code. You may optionally wrap them in `describe()` blocks for logical grouping but this is neither required nor recommended.  Jest provides a built-in `expect()` global function for making assertions. A basic test could look like this:  ```js import sum from './sum';  it('sums numbers', () => {   expect(sum(1, 2)).toEqual(3);   expect(sum(2, 2)).toEqual(4); }); ```  All `expect()` matchers supported by Jest are [extensively documented here](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/expect.html).<br> You can also use [`jest.fn()` and `expect(fn).toBeCalled()`](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/expect.html#tohavebeencalled) to create “spies” or mock functions. "
3416,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,### Testing Components,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,3," There is a broad spectrum of component testing techniques. They range from a “smoke test” verifying that a component renders without throwing, to shallow rendering and testing some of the output, to full rendering and testing component lifecycle and state changes.  Different projects choose different testing tradeoffs based on how often components change, and how much logic they contain. If you haven’t decided on a testing strategy yet, we recommend that you start with creating simple smoke tests for your components:  ```js import React from 'react'; import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'; import App from './App';  it('renders without crashing', () => {   const div = document.createElement('div');   ReactDOM.render(<App />, div); }); ```  This test mounts a component and makes sure that it didn’t throw during rendering. Tests like this provide a lot value with very little effort so they are great as a starting point, and this is the test you will find in `src/App.test.js`.  When you encounter bugs caused by changing components, you will gain a deeper insight into which parts of them are worth testing in your application. This might be a good time to introduce more specific tests asserting specific expected output or behavior.  If you’d like to test components in isolation from the child components they render, we recommend using [`shallow()` rendering API](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/shallow.html) from [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/). You can write a smoke test with it too:  ```sh npm install --save-dev enzyme react-addons-test-utils ```  ```js import React from 'react'; import { shallow } from 'enzyme'; import App from './App';  it('renders without crashing', () => {   shallow(<App />); }); ```  Unlike the previous smoke test using `ReactDOM.render()`, this test only renders `<App>` and doesn’t go deeper. For example, even if `<App>` itself renders a `<Button>` that throws, this test will pass. Shallow rendering is great for isolated unit tests, but you may still want to create some full rendering tests to ensure the components integrate correctly. Enzyme supports [full rendering with `mount()`](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/mount.html), and you can also use it for testing state changes and component lifecycle.  You can read the [Enzyme documentation](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) for more testing techniques. Enzyme documentation uses Chai and Sinon for assertions but you don’t have to use them because Jest provides built-in `expect()` and `jest.fn()` for spies.  Here is an example from Enzyme documentation that asserts specific output, rewritten to use Jest matchers:  ```js import React from 'react'; import { shallow } from 'enzyme'; import App from './App';  it('renders welcome message', () => {   const wrapper = shallow(<App />);   const welcome = <h2>Welcome to React</h2>;   // expect(wrapper.contains(welcome)).to.equal(true);   expect(wrapper.contains(welcome)).toEqual(true); }); ```  All Jest matchers are [extensively documented here](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/expect.html).<br> Nevertheless you can use a third-party assertion library like [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) if you want to, as described below.  Additionally, you might find [jest-enzyme](https://github.com/blainekasten/enzyme-matchers) helpful to simplify your tests with readable matchers. The above `contains` code can be written simpler with jest-enzyme.  ```js expect(wrapper).toContainReact(welcome) ```  To setup jest-enzyme with Create React App, follow the instructions for [initializing your test environment](#initializing-test-environment) to import `jest-enzyme`.  ```sh npm install --save-dev jest-enzyme ```  ```js // src/setupTests.js import 'jest-enzyme'; ```  "

For an example, a simple button component could have following states:  * With a text label. * With an emoji. * In the disabled mode.  Usually, it’s hard to see these states without running a sample app or some examples.  Create React App doesn’t include any tools for this by default, but you can easily add [React Storybook](https://github.com/kadirahq/react-storybook) to your project. **It is a third-party tool that lets you develop components and see all their states in isolation from your app**.  ![React Storybook Demo](http://i.imgur.com/7CIAWpB.gif)  You can also deploy your Storybook as a static app. This way, everyone in your team can view and review different states of UI components without starting a backend server or creating an account in your app.  **Here’s how to setup your app with Storybook:**  First, install the following npm package globally:  ```sh npm install -g getstorybook ```  Then, run the following command inside your app’s directory:  ```sh getstorybook ```  After that, follow the instructions on the screen.

3432,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,## Making a Progressive Web App,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,2, You can turn your React app into a [Progressive Web App](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) by following the steps in [this repository](https://github.com/jeffposnick/create-react-pwa). 
3433,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,## Deployment,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,2," `npm run build` creates a `build` directory with a production build of your app. Set up your favourite HTTP server so that a visitor to your site is served `index.html`, and requests to static paths like `/static/js/main.<hash>.js` are served with the contents of the `/static/js/main.<hash>.js` file. "
3434,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,### Static Server,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,3," For environments using [Node](https://nodejs.org/), the easiest way to handle this would be to install [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve) and let it handle the rest:  ```sh npm install -g serve serve -s build ```  The last command shown above will serve your static site on the port **5000**. Like many of [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve)’s internal settings, the port can be adjusted using the `-p` or `--port` flags.  Run this command to get a full list of the options available:  ```sh serve -h ``` "
3435,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,### Other Solutions,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,3," You don’t necessarily need a static server in order to run a Create React App project in production. It works just as fine integrated into an existing dynamic one.  Here’s a programmatic example using [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express](http://expressjs.com/):  ```javascript const express = require('express'); const path = require('path'); const app = express();  app.use(express.static('./build'));  app.get('/', function (req, res) {   res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, './build', 'index.html')); });  app.listen(9000); ```  The choice of your server software isn’t important either. Since Create React App is completely platform-agnostic, there’s no need to explicitly use Node.  The `build` folder with static assets is the only output produced by Create React App.  However this is not quite enough if you use client-side routing. Read the next section if you want to support URLs like `/todos/42` in your single-page app. "
3436,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,### Serving Apps with Client-Side Routing,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,3," If you use routers that use the HTML5 [`pushState` history API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API#Adding_and_modifying_history_entries) under the hood (for example, [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) with `browserHistory`), many static file servers will fail. For example, if you used React Router with a route for `/todos/42`, the development server will respond to `localhost:3000/todos/42` properly, but an Express serving a production build as above will not.  This is because when there is a fresh page load for a `/todos/42`, the server looks for the file `build/todos/42` and does not find it. The server needs to be configured to respond to a request to `/todos/42` by serving `index.html`. For example, we can amend our Express example above to serve `index.html` for any unknown paths:  ```diff  app.use(express.static('./build'));  -app.get('/', function (req, res) { +app.get('/*', function (req, res) {    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, './build', 'index.html'));  }); ```  If you’re using [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/), you need to create a `.htaccess` file in the `public` folder that looks like this:  ```     Options -MultiViews     RewriteEngine On     RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f     RewriteRule ^ index.html [QSA,L] ```  It will get copied to the `build` folder when you run `npm run build`.  Now requests to `/todos/42` will be handled correctly both in development and in production. "
3437,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,### Building for Relative Paths,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,3," By default, Create React App produces a build assuming your app is hosted at the server root.<br> To override this, specify the `homepage` in your `package.json`, for example:  ```js   ""homepage"": ""http://mywebsite.com/relativepath"", ```  This will let Create React App correctly infer the root path to use in the generated HTML file.

If you are not using the HTML5 `pushState` history API or not using client-side routing at all, it is unnecessary to specify the URL from which your app will be served. Instead, you can put this in your `package.json`:  ```js   ""homepage"": ""."", ```  This will make sure that all the asset paths are relative to `index.html`. You will then be able to move your app from `http://mywebsite.com` to `http://mywebsite.com/relativepath` or even `http://mywebsite.com/relative/path` without having to rebuild it. "

3447,294,https://github.com/ccbabi/demo-redux-todo,#### Notes on client-side routing,3,ccbabi.demo-redux-todo.md,4," GitHub Pages doesn’t support routers that use the HTML5 `pushState` history API under the hood (for example, React Router using `browserHistory`). This is because when there is a fresh page load for a url like `http://user.github.io/todomvc/todos/42`, where `/todos/42` is a frontend route, the GitHub Pages server returns 404 because it knows nothing of `/todos/42`. If you want to add a router to a project hosted on GitHub Pages, here are a couple of solutions:  * You could switch from using HTML5 history API to routing with hashes. If you use React Router, you can switch to `hashHistory` for this effect, but the URL will be longer and more verbose (for example, `http://user.github.io/todomvc/#/todos/42?_k=yknaj`). [Read more](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router/blob/master/docs/guides/Histories.md#histories) about different history implementations in React Router. * Alternatively, you can use a trick to teach GitHub Pages to handle 404 by redirecting to your `index.html` page with a special redirect parameter. You would need to add a `404.html` file with the redirection code to the `build` folder before deploying your project, and you’ll need to add code handling the redirect parameter to `index.html`. You can find a detailed explanation of this technique [in this guide](https://github.com/rafrex/spa-github-pages). "

3472,296,https://github.com/vanloswang/cpprestsdk,## Welcome!,1,vanloswang.cpprestsdk.md,2, The C++ REST SDK is a Microsoft project for cloud-based client-server communication in native code using a modern asynchronous C++ API design. This project aims to help C++ developers connect to and interact with services. 
3473,296,https://github.com/vanloswang/cpprestsdk,## Getting Started,36,vanloswang.cpprestsdk.md,2," Are you new to the C++ Rest SDK? To get going we recommend you start by taking a look at our [tutorial](https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk/wiki/Getting-Started-Tutorial) to use the http_client. It walks through how to setup a project to use the C++ Rest SDK and make a basic Http request. Other important information, like how to build the C++ Rest SDK from source, can be located on the [documentation](https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk/wiki) page. "
3474,296,https://github.com/vanloswang/cpprestsdk,## What's in the SDK:,1,vanloswang.cpprestsdk.md,2," *   Features - HTTP client/server, JSON, URI, asynchronous streams, WebSockets client, oAuth *   PPL Tasks - A powerful model for composing asynchronous operations based on C++ 11 features *   Platforms - Windows desktop, Windows Store, Windows Phone, Ubuntu, OS X, iOS, and Android *   Support for Visual Studio 2012, 2013, and 2015 with debugger visualizers *   NuGet package with binaries for Windows and Android platforms "
3475,296,https://github.com/vanloswang/cpprestsdk,## Contribute Back!,7,vanloswang.cpprestsdk.md,2," Is there a feature missing that you'd like to see, or found a bug that you have a fix for? Or do you have an idea or just interest in helping out in building the library? Let us know and we'd love to work with you. For a good starting point on where we are headed and feature ideas, take a look at our [requested features and bugs](https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk/issues).  Big or small we'd like to take your [contributions](https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk/wiki/Make-a-contribution-and-report-issues) back to help improve the C++ Rest SDK for everyone. If interested contact us askcasablanca at Microsoft dot com. "

On repeated scan delta reporting ensures that findings only need to be judged when they first appear in the scan results or when their output changes.  Seccubus 2.x is the only actively developed and maintained branch and all support for Seccubus V1 has officially been dropped.  Seccubus V2 works with the following scanners: * Nessus 4.x and 5.x (professional and home feed) * Skipfish * OpenVAS * Medusa (local and remote) * Nikto (local and remote) * NMap (local and remote) * SSLyze * Medusa * Burp Suite * Qualys SSL labs  For more information visit [www.seccubus.com]"

You can find our two sample galleries here:  * [Xamarin Forms Samples](http://developer.xamarin.com/samples/xamarin-forms/all/)  * [iOS Samples](http://developer.xamarin.com/samples/ios/all/)  * [Mac Samples](http://developer.xamarin.com/samples/mac/all/)  * [Android Samples](http://developer.xamarin.com/samples/android/all/) 
3488,298,https://github.com/EgoistTheBest/monodroid-samples,## Sample GitHub Repositories,6,EgoistTheBest.monodroid-samples.md,2, These sample galleries are populated by samples in our six sample GitHub repos:  * [https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-samples](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-samples)  * [https://github.com/xamarin/mobile-samples](https://github.com/xamarin/mobile-samples)  * [https://github.com/xamarin/monotouch-samples](https://github.com/xamarin/monotouch-samples)  * [https://github.com/xamarin/mac-samples](https://github.com/xamarin/mac-samples)  * [https://github.com/xamarin/monodroid-samples](https://github.com/xamarin/monodroid-samples)  * [https://github.com/xamarin/mac-ios-samples](https://github.com/xamarin/mac-ios-samples)  The [mobile-samples](https://github.com/xamarin/mobile-samples) repository is for samples that are cross-platform. The [mac-ios-samples](https://github.com/xamarin/mac-ios-samples) repository is for samples that are Mac/iOS only. 
3489,298,https://github.com/EgoistTheBest/monodroid-samples,## Sample Requirements,36,EgoistTheBest.monodroid-samples.md,2," We welcome sample submissions. Please ping Nat or Miguel for repo commit access.  However, because the sample galleries are powered by the github sample repos, each sample needs to have the following things:  * **Screenshots** - a folder called Screenshots that has at least one screen shot of the sample (preferably a screen shot for every page or every major functionality piece, people really key off these things). for the xplat samples, the folder should be split into platform folders, e.g. iOS, Android, Windows. see[ https://github.com/xamarin/mobile-samples/tree/master/Tasky/Screenshots](https://github.com/xamarin/mobile-samples/tree/master/Tasky/Screenshots) for an example of this.  * **Readme** - a[ README.md](http://readme.md/) file that has the name of the sample, a description, and author attribution. sample here:[ https://github.com/xamarin/mobile-samples/blob/master/Tasky/README.md](https://github.com/xamarin/mobile-samples/blob/master/Tasky/README.md)  * **Metadata** - Finally, it needs a Metadata.xml file ([https://github.com/xamarin/mobile-samples/blob/master/Tasky/Metadata.xml](https://github.com/xamarin/mobile-samples/blob/master/Tasky/Metadata.xml)) that has some information:      * **ID** - A GUID for the sample. You can generate this in MD under Tools menu : Insert GUID. we need this to key between articles and their associated samples      * **IsFullApplication** - Boolean flag (true or false): whether or not this is a full application such as the MWC App, Tasky, etc., or it's just a feature sample, such as, how to use 'x' feature. the basic test here is, if you would submit this to the app store because it's useful, then it's a full app, otherwise it's just a feature sample.      * **Brief** - Short description or what your sample does. This allows us to display a nice and clean vignette on the sample page.      * **Level** - Beginning, Intermediate, or Advanced: this is the intended audience level for the sample. only the getting started samples are Beginning, as they are intended for people who are _just_ starting with the platform. most samples are Intermediate, and a few, that dive deep into difficult APIs, should be Advanced.      * **Minimum License Requirement** - Starter, Indie, Business, or Enterprise: denotes the license that a user has to have in order to build/run the sample.      * **Tags**: a list of relevant tags for the app. These are:     * **Data**     * **Games**     * **Graphics** (CoreDrawing, Animation, OpenGL...)     * **Media** (Video, Sound, recording, photos)     * **Platform Features** (Photo Library, Contacts, Calendars, etc.)     * **Device Features** (NFC, Accelerometer, Compass, Magnemometer, Bluetooth, RFID)     * **Cloud** (Web Services, Networking, etc.)     * **Backgrounding**     * **Maps + Location**     * **Binding + Interop** (Projections)     * **Notifications**     * **Touch**     * **Getting Started**     * **Async**     * **FSharp**      * **SupportedPlatforms**: this is only for cross plat samples. It's a comma-separated list, and the valid values are iOS, Android, and Windows.      * **Gallery**: This tag must contain a value of true if you want the sample to show up in the samples gallery on the developer portal.  * **Buildable Sln and CSProj file** - the project _must_ build and have the appropriate project scaffolding (solution + proj).  A good example of this stuff is here in the drawing sample:[ https://github.com/xamarin/monotouch-samples/tree/master/Drawing](https://github.com/xamarin/monotouch-samples/tree/master/Drawing)  For a x-platform sample, please see: https://github.com/xamarin/mobile-samples/tree/master/Tasky "
3490,298,https://github.com/EgoistTheBest/monodroid-samples,## GitHub Integration,6,EgoistTheBest.monodroid-samples.md,2," We integrate tightly with Git to make sure we always provide working samples to our customers. This is achieved through a pre-commit hook that runs before your commit goes through, as well as a post-receive hook on GitHub's end that notifies our samples gallery server when changes go through.  To you, as a sample committer, this means that before you push to the repos, you should run the ""install-hook.bat"" or ""install-hook.sh"" (depending on whether you're on Windows or OS X/Linux, respectively). These will install the Git pre-commit hook. Now, whenever you try to make a Git commit, all samples in the repo will be validated. If any sample fails to validate, the commit is aborted; otherwise, your commit goes through and you can go ahead and push.  This strict approach is put in place to ensure that the samples we present to our customers are always in a good state, and to ensure that all samples integrate correctly with the sample gallery (README.md, Metadata.xml, etc). Note that the master branch of each sample repo is what we present to our customers for our stable releases, so they must *always* Just Work.  Should you wish to invoke validation of samples manually, simply run ""validate.windows"" or ""validate.posix"" (again, Windows vs OS X/Linux, respectively). These must be run from a Bash shell (i.e. a terminal on OS X/Linux or the Git Bash terminal on Windows).  If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask! "

It builds upon the strengths of Java, but has additional power features inspired by languages like Python, Ruby and Smalltalk. Groovy makes modern programming features available to Java developers with almost-zero learning curve as well as supports Domain-Specific Languages and other compact syntax so your code becomes easy to read and maintain. Groovy makes writing shell and build scripts easy with its powerful processing primitives, OO abilities and an Ant DSL. It also increases developer productivity by reducing scaffolding code when developing web, GUI, database or console applications. Groovy simplifies testing by supporting unit testing and mocking out-of-the-box. Groovy also seamlessly integrates with all existing Java classes and libraries and compiles straight to Java bytecode so you can use it anywhere you can use Java.

It features a all-in-memory execution guideline and leaves very low footprint. Pupy can communicate using various transports, migrate into processes (reflective injection), load remote python code, python packages and python C-extensions from memory. Pupy modules can transparently access remote python objects using rpyc to perform various interactive tasks. Pupy can generate payloads in multiple formats like PE executables, reflective DLLs, pure python files, powershell, apk, ... When you package a payload, you can choose a launcher (connect, bind, ...), a transport (ssl, http, rsa, obfs3, scramblesuit, ...) and a number of ""scriptlets"". Scriptlets are python scripts meant to be embedded to perform various tasks offline (without requiring a session), like starting a background script, adding persistence, starting a keylogger, detecting a sandbox, ...

The imported python modules do not touch the disk. - Pupy is easily extensible, modules are quite simple to write, sorted by os and category. - A lot of awesome modules are already implemented! - Pupy uses [rpyc](https://github.com/tomerfiliba/rpyc) and a module can directly access python objects on the remote client   - We can also access remote objects interactively from the pupy shell and you even get auto-completion of remote attributes! - Communication transports are modular, stackable and awesome. You could exfiltrate data using HTTP over HTTP over AES over XOR. Or any combination of the available transports ! - Pupy can communicate using obfsproxy [pluggable transports](https://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports.html.en) - All the non interactive modules can be dispatched to multiple hosts in one command - Commands and scripts running on remote hosts are interruptible - Auto-completion for commands and arguments - Custom config can be defined: command aliases, modules automatically run at connection, ... - Interactive python shells with auto-completion on the all in memory remote python interpreter can be opened - Interactive shells (cmd.exe, /bin/bash, ...) can be opened remotely. Remote shells on Unix & windows clients have a real tty with all keyboard signals working fine just like a ssh shell - Pupy can execute PE exe remotely and from memory (cf. ex with mimikatz) - Pupy can generate payloads in various formats : apk,lin_x86,lin_x64,so_x86,so_x64,exe_x86,exe_x64,dll_x86,dll_x64,py,pyinst,py_oneliner,ps1,ps1_oneliner,rubber_ducky - Pupy can be deployed in memory, from a single command line using pupygen.py's python or powershell one-liners. - ""scriptlets"" can be embeded in generated payloads to perform some tasks ""offline"" without needing network connectivity (ex: start keylogger, add persistence, execute custom python script, check_vm ...) - tons of other features, check out the implemented modules "

3598,312,https://github.com/jbakic/Shielded,# Shielded,123,jbakic.Shielded.md,1,"========  Available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Shielded).  Shielded is a full-featured implementation of Software Transactional Memory in .NET. It provides a system (the Shield static class) for running in-memory transactions, and data structures which are aware of transactions. It can also generate transaction-aware proxy subclasses based on a POCO class type. The implementation is strict, with strong guarantees on safety. It is mostly lock-free, using only one major lock which is held during the pre-commit check.  Here is a small example:  ```csharp var n = new Shielded<int>(); int a = n; Shield.InTransaction(() =>     n.Value = n + 5); ```  Shielded fields are thread-safe. You can read them out of transaction, but changes must be done inside. While inside, the library guarantees a consistent view of all shielded fields.  Another example, the STM version of ""Hello world!"" - parallel addition in an array. Here, in a dictionary:  ```csharp var dict = new ShieldedDict<int, int>(); ParallelEnumerable.Range(0, 100000)     .ForAll(i => Shield.InTransaction(() =>         dict[i % 100] = dict.ContainsKey(i % 100) ? dict[i % 100] + 1 : 1)); ```  Shielded works with value types, and the language automatically does the needed cloning. For ref types, it only makes the reference itself transactional. The class should then be immutable, or, if you have a class you want to make transactional:  ```csharp public class TestClass {     public virtual Guid Id { get; set; }     public virtual string Name { get; set; } } ```  Then you create instances like this:  ```csharp using Shielded.ProxyGen; ... var t = Factory.NewShielded<TestClass>(); ```  The Factory creates a proxy sub-class, using CodeDom, which will have transactional overrides for all virtual properties of the base class that are public or protected. Due to CodeDom limitations, the getter and setter must have the same accessibility! The proxy objects are thread-safe (or, at least their virtual properties are), and can only be changed inside transactions. Usage is simple:  ```csharp var id = t.Id; Shield.InTransaction(() =>     t.Name = ""Test object""); ```  It is safe to execute any number of concurrent transactions that are reading from or writing into the same shielded fields - each transaction will complete correctly. This is accomplished by: * ensuring that in one transaction you read a consistent state of all shielded fields * buffering writes into storage which is local for each thread  Your changes are commited and made visible to other threads only if all the shielded fields you read or wrote into have not changed since you started. If any have new changes, your transaction is retried from the beginning, but this time reading the new data. Though it may seem so, this cannot create an infinite loop since for any conflict to occur at least one transaction must successfully commit. Overall, the system must make progress.  This quality would place Shielded in the lock-free class of non-blocking concurrency mechanisms, according to academic classification. However, this is not accurate since the commit check gets done under a lock. Hence the word ""mostly"" in the short description. "
3599,312,https://github.com/jbakic/Shielded,## Features,1,jbakic.Shielded.md,2,"--------  * **MVCC**: Each transaction reads a consistent snapshot of the state without the need for locking, since updates just create new versions.     * Old versions are dropped soon after no one is capable of reading them     any more. * **Read-only transactions** always complete without any repetitions and without entering the global lock! * **Strictness**: If a write is made anywhere, the system will insist that all touched locations, read or written, still contain the same version of data that they had when the transaction opened. This means it does not suffer from the Write Skew issue. * **Transactional collections**: Included in the library are ShieldedDict<> (dictionary), ShieldedSeq<> (singly linked list) and ShieldedTree<> (a red-black tree implementation).     * It is possible to use this library with immutable collections from     [System.Collections.Immutable](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt452182%28v=vs.110%29.aspx). * **Transaction-local storage**: ShieldedLocal<> allows storing anything in the transaction context, visible only from within that transaction. * To perform **side-effects** (IO, and most other operations which are not shielded) you use the SideEffect method of the Shield class, which takes optional onCommit and onRollback lambdas, or the **SyncSideEffect** method which allows you to execute code during a commit, while the changed fields are still locked. * **Conditional transactions**: Method Shield.Conditional allows you to define something similar to a database AFTER trigger. It receives a test, and an action to perform, both lambdas. It runs the test, makes a note of all shielded objects that the test had accessed, and later re-executes the test when any of those objects is committed into. If test passes, the action is called.     * Implemented transactionally, so can be called from transactions, and     can be triggered by the transaction that created it.     * Returns an IDisposable for deactivating the subscription, also     transactionally. It may even deactivate itself, e.g. to guarantee one-time execution. * **Pre-commit checks**: Shield.PreCommit is very similar to Shield.Conditional, but executes the test within a transaction that changes one of the fields it is interested in, just before that transaction will commit.     * Can be used to ensure certain invariants are held, or to implement     thread prioritization by allowing only some threads which access a field     to commit into it. * **Custom commit operations**: You can integrate your own code into the commit process, to execute while the shielded fields, that are being written, are held locked.     * Already mentioned Shield.SyncSideEffect does this on the level of one transaction.     * Using Shield.WhenCommitting, you subscribe globally for any commit, or based on     the type of field being written. These subscriptions should never throw!     * Shield.RunToCommit runs a transaction just up to commit, and allows you to     commit/rollback later, or from another thread. This is useful for asynchronous     programming. * **Commutables**: operations which can be performed without conflict, because they can be reordered in time and have the same net effect, i.e. they are commutable (name borrowed from Clojure). Incrementing an int is an example - if you don’t care what the int’s value is, you can increment it without conflict by simply incrementing whatever value you encounter there at commit time. Using commutes, when appropriate, reduces conflicts and improves concurrency. Incrementing an int, conflict-free:      ```csharp     n.Commute((ref int a) => a++);     ```      * Commutes are not performed under any lock, but rather in a special     commute subtransaction, which reads the latest data, and tries to     commit with the same stamp as your main transaction. If only the commutes     fail, then only the commutes get retried.     * If, in the example above, your main transaction has already (or perhaps     will later) read the n field or written to it (non-commutatively), the     commute “degenerates” - it gets executed in place, in your transaction,     and you can see it’s effect. This means consistency - if you read it, it     will stay as read when you commit. But, it is now a potential conflict.     * Shield has various commutable operations defined in it. Appending to a     sequence is commutable - if you do not touch the seq, it never conflicts.     Collection Count fields are comuted over, to avoid unnecessary conflicts."

Due to the way the plugin works, to set the database dialect, you need to change a separate file instead of just use the aw-reporting properties file:  > aw-reporting/aw-reporting-model/src/main/resources/hbm2ddl/hibernate.properties  The configured dialect is MySQL. Make sure to change this to be the same that is being used in the main properties file.  To run the schema generation, just go to a command line, cd into aw-reporting-model folder, and run the following:  <code>mvn hibernate4:export -Phbm2ddl</code>  This will create a ""schema.sql"" in the ""target/"" folder of the project.  *Important Note*: The schema creates the whole database assuming that none of the tables were created before. To update the database you will need to go through the SQL file and delete the unnecessary code. "
3616,314,https://github.com/ashusa303/aw-reporting,## Details about the code,3,ashusa303.aw-reporting.md,2," For better organization and encapsulation, the project groups the reporting workflow into two parts: **Aw-Report-Model** for persistence, entities and the CSV mapping to AdWords information and **Aw-Reporting** for the logic (API services, downloader and processors). "
3617,314,https://github.com/ashusa303/aw-reporting,### Aw-Report-Model,3,ashusa303.aw-reporting.md,3,"Provides all the necessary classes to persist data and the entities’ mapping to AdWords report data.  * **Entities:** these POJOs define all the available fields for each report kind as java fields, by using annotations. The Entities contain the information to link the java fields to the report fields definition, the csv display name header fields and the datastore fields.  * **CSV:** The CSV classes use the OpenCSV library to convert CSV files into Java beans using annotations. The package also contains two new annotations to define the Report Definition Type and the mapping between java field, report’s Column Name and Display Name headers. For example:    + Annotation **@CsvReport** at the Report class level, for example for ReportAccount: <code>@CsvReport(value=   ReportDefinitionReportType.ACCOUNT_PERFORMANCE_REPORT) public class ReportAccount extends Report {...</code>    + Annotation **@CsvField** at the java field level, for example for avgCpm: <code>@CsvField (value = ""Avg. CPM"", reportField = ""AverageCpm"") public BigDecimal avgCpm;</code>  + **Persistence:** The persistence layer uses Spring for bean management, injection and in class annotations, this helps to clearly demarcate the application layers. AuthTokenPersister: is the interface for the authorization token storage, we have implemented it for Mysql and a MongoDB. ReportEntitiesPersister is the interface for the report entities storage, we have implemented it for Mysql and a MongoDB.  "

This class can be replaced by a custom processor by changing the bean component in the projects xml configuration files.  * **API Services:** Beside the report Downloader calls to AdHoc Reports, the ManagedCustomerDelegate is the only class talking to the AdWords API, it is in charge of getting all the account ids in the MCC tree.  * **AwReporting main:** The AwReporting main class is in charge of printing the help information, of the properties file example and of passing the command line parameters to the processor for execution. "
3619,314,https://github.com/ashusa303/aw-reporting,## Offline Data Import,3,ashusa303.aw-reporting.md,2," In order to support some report types that are not yet available in the API, but are available in the AdWords Interface, we introduced the feature of importing data to the database directly from CSV files that were downloaded from the interface.  The offline data import works just as the online mode (where the data is downloaded from the API), but skips the download step. All the field mappings and report types supported are still the same, but keep in mind that most of the entity IDs are not available in the reports downloaded from the interface.  **IMPORTANT NOTE:** Before importing the CSV with AwReporting, you must edit the file and make sure that it's in the same format as the CSV file downloaded from the API: * First line must contain the name or description of the report; * Second line must contain the column names/headers; * Following lines must contain the data.  Usually when you download a report from the interface, the CSV file will contain some additional lines in the beginning of the file. You have to remove those lines before importing it into AwReporting.  To use the offline import data, you just need to specify in the command line the report type that you will import, and the local file that you will use as an addition to the other arguments:  ``` $ java -Xmx1G -jar aw-reporting/target/aw-reporting.jar -startDate YYYYMMDD -endDate YYYYMMDD \ -file aw-reporting/src/main/resources/aw-report-sample.properties \ -onFileReport CAMPAIGN_PERFORMANCE_REPORT -csvReportFile <CSV FILE LOCATION> ```  **IMPORTANT NOTE:** The dates specified are very import, because they will be used to populate the database following the same format as the data downloaded from the API. Date periods *are not supported*. "
3620,314,https://github.com/ashusa303/aw-reporting,## **Experimental:** Video Campaign Performance report,3,ashusa303.aw-reporting.md,2," With the offline data import feature available, we added the Video Campaign Performance Report to AwReporting model. This means that it's now possible to download the Video Performance reports from the interface, import it into AwReporting and make the data available in the database.  This report still an experiment, and we want to hear more feedback from users in order to further improve this, and make sure that this is in fact a necessity.  To import video campaign performance reports in AwReport, just run the following command:  ``` $ java -Xmx1G -jar aw-reporting/target/aw-reporting.jar -startDate YYYYMMDD -endDate YYYYMMDD \ -file aw-reporting/src/main/resources/aw-report-sample.properties \ -onFileReport VIDEO_CAMPAIGN_REPORT -csvReportFile <CSV FILE LOCATION> ```  **IMPORTANT NOTE:** The API *does not support* video campaign reports. This is a work around to import video campaign reports into the database, facilitating the usage of the data in your applications. "

Users are asked to submit their solution to a programming assignment which are automatically graded. For each user we have at our disposal a number of informations: * the grade of the related submission * a timestamp of the submission * the time between two submissions * some events associated to a submission (e.g. if the user has watched a video, posted a message on the forum etc.) that illustrate the strategy followed by the user.

3633,316,https://github.com/ThomasGrivaz/Learning-Analytics-Project,## Hypotheses & Features Selection:,1,ThomasGrivaz.Learning-Analytics-Project.md,2,"The MOOC is composed of 3 main components: videos, forum and problems. Each of these components have events associated with. For example for the video components, we can track if a user has played a video, how long he watched it or if he paused the video. Similarly for the forum we can know if a user has posted comments, watched a thread etc.   The goal here is to make relevant hypotheses and extract associated features that reflect a learning behaviour. Three features were already extracted in the Python code supplied: the duration of a video activity, the average time difference between two videos watched and the number of forum threads viewed.  __Hypotheses related to video events__ * the time spent watching videos has a positive effect on the next submission grade  * --> count the time spent (`DurationOfVideoActivity`) * the more frequently a user watches a video, the more chances he has to increase his grade  * --> extract the duration between two videos watched and compute the mean (`AverageVideoTimeDiffs`) * the number of different videos watched has a positive effect on the next submission grade  * --> count the number of different videos (`NumberVideoWatched`) * if the learner seeks to specific points in the video lectures, (s)he is actively engaged with the course material  * --> count the number of seek events (`NumberOfSeekEvents`)  __Hypothese related to forum events__ * the number of threads viewed has a positive effect on the next submission grade  * --> count the number of thread views (`NumberOfThreadViews`) * the number of thread created has a positive effect on the next submission grade  * --> count the number of thread launched (`NumberOfThreadCreated`) * the number of comments posted has a positive effect on the next submission grade  * --> count the number of comments posted (`NumberOfComments`) * When a learner upvotes a post or a comment, most likely they found the contet helpful and it helped them solve their problems, this might have a positive effect on the next submission grade.  * --> count the number of upvotes for both comments and posts (`NumberOfUpvotes`)  __Hypothese combining both events (bigrams and trigrams)__ * watching a video followed by posting  __Other hypotheses__ * the time between two submissions should be indicative of the grade difference. A lot of submissions with relatively small time durations between submissions reflect a ""trial and error"" pattern where the learner typically tests some lines of code and wants to see the result by submitting. This behaviour is prone to errors in the code and as such should have a negative effect on the grade. *TODO (probably secondary features for regression task)  * --> find out if certain sequences of behavior are good predictors of improvement  * --> compute more in-depth representations of what happened on the forum (did someone reply to your forum thread? Did you reply to them?)"

There's a Debian   package, so installation is easy; the only caveat is that it requires Java   (sorry).    You can build the dev track simply by running:      $ ./build.sh dev    The first time this is run, this will download and build all dependencies   (except Bazel, of course). This can take a while, so be patient. Don't expect   status updates for a minute or two at a time in some cases. Subsequent builds   will be extremely fast; Bazel excels at doing incremental builds.    Don't be alarmed if you see a few warnings. In particular, the linker may   complain about duplicated symbols.    If successful, Bazel will output something like this:      Target //:mosh_chrome up-to-date:       bazel-genfiles/mosh_chrome_dev.zip    That .zip file contains the entire app. To load it into Chrome, unzip it into   a directory on your machine, then go to chrome://extensions, enable   ""Developer mode"", and click the ""Load unpacked extension button"", directing   it to said directory. Then the app will be launchable from the app screen and   the extensions screen.    To distribute the app, build the release track and upload the .zip file to   the Chrome Web Store."

3669,322,https://github.com/zouzias/docker-elk,## Setup,3,zouzias.docker-elk.md,2, 1. Install [Docker](http://docker.io). 2. Install [Docker-compose](http://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). 3. Clone this repository 
3670,322,https://github.com/zouzias/docker-elk,## SELinux,3,zouzias.docker-elk.md,2," On distributions which have SELinux enabled out-of-the-box you will need to either re-context the files or set SELinux into Permissive mode in order for docker-elk to start properly. For example on Redhat and CentOS, the following will apply the proper context:  ````bash .-root@centos ~ -$ chcon -R system_u:object_r:admin_home_t:s0 docker-elk/ ````"
3671,322,https://github.com/zouzias/docker-elk,## Windows,36,zouzias.docker-elk.md,2," When cloning this repo on Windows with line ending conversion enabled (git option `core.autocrlf` set to `true`), the script `kibana/entrypoint.sh` will malfunction due to a corrupt shebang header (which must not terminated by `CR+LF` but `LF` only):  ````bash ... Creating dockerelk_kibana_1 Attaching to dockerelk_elasticsearch_1, dockerelk_logstash_1, dockerelk_kibana_1 : No such file or directory/usr/bin/env: bash ````  So you have to either  * disable line ending conversion *before* cloning the repository by setting `core.autocrlf` set to `false`: `git config core.autocrlf false`, or * convert the line endings in script `kibana/entrypoint.sh` from `CR+LF` to `LF` (e.g. using Notepad++).  See [issue 36](../../issues/36) for details. "
3672,322,https://github.com/zouzias/docker-elk,# Usage,36,zouzias.docker-elk.md,1," Start the ELK stack using *docker-compose*:  ```bash $ docker-compose up ```  You can also choose to run it in background (detached mode):  ```bash $ docker-compose up -d ```  Now that the stack is running, you'll want to inject logs in it. The shipped logstash configuration allows you to send content via tcp:  ```bash $ nc localhost 5000 < /path/to/logfile.log ```  And then access Kibana UI by hitting [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601) with a web browser.  *NOTE*: You'll need to inject data into logstash before being able to create a logstash index in Kibana. Then all you should have to do is to hit the create button.  See: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/setup.html#connect  You can also access: * Sense: [http://localhost:5601/app/sense](http://localhost:5601/app/sense)  *NOTE*: In order to use Sense, you'll need to query the IP address associated to your *network device* instead of localhost.  By default, the stack exposes the following ports: * 5000: Logstash TCP input. * 9200: Elasticsearch HTTP * 9300: Elasticsearch TCP transport * 5601: Kibana  *WARNING*: If you're using *boot2docker*, you must access it via the *boot2docker* IP address instead of *localhost*.  *WARNING*: If you're using *Docker Toolbox*, you must access it via the *docker-machine* IP address instead of *localhost*. "
3673,322,https://github.com/zouzias/docker-elk,# Configuration,3,zouzias.docker-elk.md,1," *NOTE*: Configuration is not dynamically reloaded, you will need to restart the stack after any change in the configuration of a component. "
3674,322,https://github.com/zouzias/docker-elk,## How can I tune Kibana configuration?,3,zouzias.docker-elk.md,2, The Kibana default configuration is stored in `kibana/config/kibana.yml`. 
3675,322,https://github.com/zouzias/docker-elk,## How can I tune Logstash configuration?,3,zouzias.docker-elk.md,2," The logstash configuration is stored in `logstash/config/logstash.conf`.  The folder `logstash/config` is mapped onto the container `/etc/logstash/conf.d` so you can create more than one file in that folder if you'd like to. However, you must be aware that config files will be read from the directory in alphabetical order. "
3676,322,https://github.com/zouzias/docker-elk,## How can I specify the amount of memory used by Logstash?,3,zouzias.docker-elk.md,2," The Logstash container use the *LS_HEAP_SIZE* environment variable to determine how much memory should be associated to the JVM heap memory (defaults to 500m).  If you want to override the default configuration, add the *LS_HEAP_SIZE* environment variable to the container in the `docker-compose.yml`:  ```yml logstash:   build: logstash/   command: logstash -f /etc/logstash/conf.d/logstash.conf   volumes:     - ./logstash/config:/etc/logstash/conf.d   ports:     - ""5000:5000""   links:     - elasticsearch   environment:     - LS_HEAP_SIZE=2048m ``` "
3677,322,https://github.com/zouzias/docker-elk,## How can I add Logstash plugins? ##,3,zouzias.docker-elk.md,2, To add plugins to logstash you have to:  1. Add a RUN statement to the `logstash/Dockerfile` (ex. `RUN logstash-plugin install logstash-filter-json`) 2. Add the associated plugin code configuration to the `logstash/config/logstash.conf` file 
3678,322,https://github.com/zouzias/docker-elk,## How can I enable a remote JMX connection to Logstash?,3,zouzias.docker-elk.md,2," As for the Java heap memory, another environment variable allows to specify JAVA_OPTS used by Logstash. You'll need to specify the appropriate options to enable JMX and map the JMX port on the docker host.  Update the container in the `docker-compose.yml` to add the *LS_JAVA_OPTS* environment variable with the following content (I've mapped the JMX service on the port 18080, you can change that), do not forget to update the *-Djava.rmi.server.hostname* option with the IP address of your Docker host (replace **DOCKER_HOST_IP**):  ```yml logstash:   build: logstash/   command: logstash -f /etc/logstash/conf.d/logstash.conf   volumes:     - ./logstash/config:/etc/logstash/conf.d   ports:     - ""5000:5000""     - ""18080:18080""   links:     - elasticsearch   environment:     - LS_JAVA_OPTS=-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=18080 -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port=18080 -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=DOCKER_HOST_IP -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.local.only=false ``` "
3679,322,https://github.com/zouzias/docker-elk,## How can I tune Elasticsearch configuration?,3,zouzias.docker-elk.md,2," The Elasticsearch container is using the shipped configuration and it is not exposed by default.  If you want to override the default configuration, create a file `elasticsearch/config/elasticsearch.yml` and add your configuration in it.  Then, you'll need to map your configuration file inside the container in the `docker-compose.yml`. Update the elasticsearch container declaration to:  ```yml elasticsearch:   build: elasticsearch/   command: elasticsearch -Des.network.host=_non_loopback_   ports:     - ""9200:9200""   volumes:     - ./elasticsearch/config/elasticsearch.yml:/usr/share/elasticsearch/config/elasticsearch.yml ```  You can also specify the options you want to override directly in the command field:  ```yml elasticsearch:   build: elasticsearch/   command: elasticsearch -Des.network.host=_non_loopback_ -Des.cluster.name: my-cluster   ports:     - ""9200:9200"" ``` "

3681,322,https://github.com/zouzias/docker-elk,## How can I store Elasticsearch data?,3,zouzias.docker-elk.md,2," The data stored in Elasticsearch will be persisted after container reboot but not after container removal.  In order to persist Elasticsearch data even after removing the Elasticsearch container, you'll have to mount a volume on your Docker host. Update the elasticsearch container declaration to:  ```yml elasticsearch:   build: elasticsearch/   command: elasticsearch -Des.network.host=_non_loopback_   ports:     - ""9200:9200""   volumes:     - /path/to/storage:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data ```  This will store elasticsearch data inside `/path/to/storage`."

Walk over all components and check out the `@providesModule` info. 2. When webpack build bundle, it makes your components recognised rather than throwing an error. 3. It will help webpack build bundle with correct file depending on the tar* platform.  You can find something like `@providesModule ReactActivityIndicator` on `react-web` component's comment, yes, it's for `HasteResolverPlugin`. "

But in fact it is quite different in React Web. When `require('react-native')`, in the construction of the webpack will be renamed, equivalent to `require('react-web')`.  At the same time, this form of writing will put all the components into at one time, including `ReactAppRegistry` `ReactView` and so on, even some components the you did not use. "
3697,324,https://github.com/cpunion/react-web,#### The Haste way,3,cpunion.react-web.md,4," ```js var AppRegistry = require('ReactAppRegistry'); var View = require('ReactView'); var Text = require('ReactText'); var Platform = require('ReactPlatform'); ```  In this way, we load our components on demand, such as `ReactAppRegistry` or `ReactView` and so on.  Packaged components so that we no longer need to care about the differences between the platform.  As mentioned above, the HasteResolverPlugin plugin will help webpack to compile and package the code. "

Should care about fetch domain on web platform   ```js   var fetch = Platform.OS === 'web'? require('ReactJsonp'): require('ReactFetch');   ```  4. Without some APIs like `LayoutAnimation` on web platform   ```js   var LayoutAnimation = require('ReactLayoutAnimation')   if(Platform.OS !== 'web'){     LayoutAnimation.configureNext(...)   }   ```  5.

See http://www.stoqs.org. 
3799,331,https://github.com/carueda/stoqs,#### Getting started with a STOQS development system,36,carueda.stoqs.md,4," First, install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) &mdash; there are standard installers for Mac, Windows, and Linux. (You will also need [X Windows System](doc/instructions/XWINDOWS.md) sofware on your computer.) Then create an empty folder off your home directory such as `Vagrants/stoqsvm`, open a command prompt window, cd to that folder, and enter these commands:  ```bash curl ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stoqs/stoqs/master/Vagrantfile"" -o Vagrantfile curl ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stoqs/stoqs/master/provision.sh"" -o provision.sh vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest vagrant up --provider virtualbox ```  The `vagrant up` command takes an hour or so to provision and setup a complete CentOS 7 STOQS server that also includes MB-System, InstantReality, and all the Python data science tools bundled in packages such as Anaconda.  All connections to this virtual machine are performed from the the directory you installed it in; you must cd to it (e.g. `cd ~/Vagrants/stoqsvm`) before logging in with the `vagrant ssh -- -X` command.  After installation finishes log into your new virtual machine and test it:  ```bash vagrant ssh -- -X   # Wait for [vagrant@localhost ~]$ prompt cd ~/dev/stoqsgit && source venv-stoqs/bin/activate export DATABASE_URL=postgis://stoqsadm:CHANGEME@127.0.0.1:5432/stoqs ./test.sh CHANGEME ```  In another terminal window start the development server (after a `cd ~/Vagrants/stoqsvm`):  ```bash vagrant ssh -- -X   # Wait for [vagrant@localhost ~]$ prompt cd ~/dev/stoqsgit && source venv-stoqs/bin/activate export DATABASE_URL=postgis://stoqsadm:CHANGEME@127.0.0.1:5432/stoqs stoqs/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 --settings=config.settings.local ```  Visit your server's STOQS User Interface using your host computer's browser:      http://localhost:8000  More instructions are in the doc/instructions directory &mdash; see [LOADING](doc/instructions/LOADING.md) for how to load your own data and [CONTRIBUTING](doc/instructions/CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to share your work. See example [Jupyter Notebooks](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/stoqs/stoqs/blob/master/stoqs/contrib/notebooks)  that demonstrate specific analyses and visualizations that cannot be accomplished in the STOQS User Interface. Visit the [STOQS Wiki pages](https://github.com/stoqs/stoqs/wiki) for updates and links to presentations. The [stoqs-discuss](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/stoqs-discuss) list in Google Groups is also a good place to ask questions and engage in discussion with the STOQS user and developer communities.  Supported by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, STOQS undergoes continual development to help support the mission of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institue.  If you have your own server you will occasionally want to get new features with:  ```bash git pull ./setup.sh ```  If you use STOQS for your research please cite this publication:  > McCann, M.; Schramm, R.; Cline, D.; Michisaki, R.; Harvey, J.; Ryan, J., ""Using STOQS (The spatial > temporal oceanographic query system) to manage, visualize, and understand AUV, glider, and mooring data,"" > in *Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV), 2014 IEEE/OES*, pp.1-10, 6-9 Oct. 2014 > doi: 10.1109/AUV.2014.7054414 "

You can make an AR application using visual code like ARToolKit using this framework. CoreAR.framework does not depend on the other computer vision library like OpenCV. Considered portability, this framework is written only C or C++. The pixel array of an image is passed to CoreAR.framework and then visual code's identification number, rotation and translation matrix are obtained from the image including a visual code. Image processing speed of this framework is about 15 fps on iPhone4.  Take notice that CoreAR.framework depends on [Quartz Help Library][] and [Real time image processing framework for iOS][].

3812,334,https://github.com/wthit56/node.unnecessary.js,# Node.Unnecessary.js,12,wthit56.node.unnecessary.js.md,1," My previous (and ongiong) project, Unnecesary.js, focussed on built-in behaviours and methods within JavaScript. The idea was to demonstrate, through easy-to-follow, well-commented code, how things worked behind the scenes. How does the event loop work? How does type coersion work when comparing two values?  The group of source .js files were created to educate people on how JavaScript worked from the inside out. But beyond that, they were pretty useless... ""unnecesary"", you might say.  With the new project of Node.Unnecesary.js, I take this methodology to the world of node.js. This time, however, the .js files could be of some use to people. The browser doesn't have many of the utility objects and methods available to node users. So I've created the source files with this in mind.  You can require(.js) and use the code as per usual in node, or add a reference to the .js file in a web page, and the ""module"" will be added to the window object, allowing you to use its functionality in your browser-based code.  There are a few small tweaks to how things work so that the module is more useful when used in a browser, for urls and the like. "

3815,335,https://github.com/victorkamenov/scsh,# Scsh,12,victorkamenov.scsh.md,1,"==== Scsh is a unix shell embedded in Scheme. What does that mean? Well, unix shells are powerful tools. They allow a user to concisely specify her commands and the communications between them (piping, redirecting, &c.). When she needs to do something more complex than running a set of commands with known inputs, however, things become complicated. General programming with sh can be unpleasant and error prone, to say the least.  Scheme is a simple, expressive general programming language. A user with some taste may want to use it to wield her computing machine. For simple commands, however, it is not the most concise. At the scale of the command line, even the overhead of parentheses matters. It would be nice to use each of these languages where their strengths lie.  Scsh is the solution. It allows the user to write commands in a language within Scheme that follows the unix way, but also allows her to specify more complex commands with the elegance of Scheme. "

The complete set of BLAS level 1, 2 & 3 routines is implemented. Please see Netlib BLAS for the list of supported routines. In addition to GPU devices, the library also supports running on CPU devices to facilitate debugging and multicore programming. APPML 1.10 is the most current generally available pre-packaged binary version of the library available for download for both Linux and Windows platforms.  The primary goal of clBLAS is to make it easier for developers to utilize the inherent performance and power efficiency benefits of heterogeneous computing. clBLAS interfaces do not hide nor wrap OpenCL interfaces, but rather leaves OpenCL state management to the control of the user to allow for maximum performance and flexibility. The clBLAS library does generate and enqueue optimized OpenCL kernels, relieving the user from the task of writing, optimizing and maintaining kernel code themselves. "

AutoGemm is a suite of python scripts which generate optimized kernels and kernel selection logic, for all precisions, transposes, tile sizes and so on.   - CMake is configured to use AutoGemm for clBLAS so the build and usage experience of Gemm remains unchanged (only performance and maintainability has been improved). Kernel sources are generated at build time (not runtime) and can be configured within CMake to be pre-compiled at build time.   - clBLAS users with unique Gemm requirements can customize AutoGemm to their needs (such as non-default tile sizes for very small or very skinny matrices); see [AutoGemm](http://github.com/clMathLibraries/clBLAS/wiki/AutoGemm) documentation for details.

The bindings are currently undocumented, but as the code mostly just consists of external declarations with type signatures, the code itself is fairly self-documenting.

3886,343,https://github.com/BuckleTypes/bs-webapi-incubator,## Usage,3,BuckleTypes.bs-webapi-incubator.md,2, See the [examples folder](https://github.com/BuckleTypes/bs-webapi-incubator/tree/eb5f71847848a3e896733017fde00eee7fb5edf5/examples) 
3887,343,https://github.com/BuckleTypes/bs-webapi-incubator,## Some notes on the DOM API,3,BuckleTypes.bs-webapi-incubator.md,2," The DOM API is mostly organized into interfaces and relies heavily on inheritance. The ergonomics of the API is also heavily dependent on dynamic typing, which makes it somewhat challenging to implement a thin binding layer that is both safe and ergonomic. To achieve this we employ subtyping and implementation inheritance, concepts which aren't very idiomatic to OCaml (or Reason), but all the more beneficial to understand in order to be able to use these bindings effectively. "
3888,343,https://github.com/BuckleTypes/bs-webapi-incubator,### Subtyping,3,BuckleTypes.bs-webapi-incubator.md,3," The Dom types, and the relationships between them, are actually defined in the `Dom` module that ships with `bs-platform` ([Source code](https://github.com/glennsl/bucklescript/blob/master/jscomp/others/dom.mli)), where you'll find a bunch of types that look like this:  ```ml type 'a _element type 'a element_like = 'a _element node_like type element = _baseClass element_like ```  This is subtyping implemented with abstract types and phantom arguments. The details of how this works isn't very important (but see [#23](https://github.com/BuckleTypes/bs-webapi-incubator/pull/23) for a detailed explanation of how exactly this trickery works) in order to just use them, but there are a few things you should know:  * If you expand the alias of a concrete DOM type, you'll discover it's actually a list of abstract types. e.g. `element` expands to `_baseClass _element _node _eventTarget_like` This means `element` is a subtype of `_element`, `_node` and `_eventTarget_like`. * The `_like` type are ""open"" (because they have a type variable). This means that a function accepting an `'a element_like` will accept any ""supertype"" of `element_like`. A function accepting just an `element` will only accept an `element` (Technically `element` is actually a ""supertype"" of `element_like` too).  This system works exceptionally well, but has one significant flaw: It makes type errors even more complicated than they normally are.

3889,343,https://github.com/BuckleTypes/bs-webapi-incubator,### Implementation inheritance,3,BuckleTypes.bs-webapi-incubator.md,3," If you've looked through the source code a bit, you've likely come across code like this:  ```reason include EventTargetRe.Impl { type nonrec t = t }; include NodeRe.Impl { type nonrec t = t }; include ParentNodeRe.Impl { type nonrec t = t }; include NonDocumentTypeChildNodeRe.Impl { type nonrec t = t }; include ChildNodeRe.Impl { type nonrec t = t }; include SlotableRe.Impl { type nonrec t = t }; include Impl { type nonrec t = t }; ```  This is the implementation inheritance. Each ""inheritable"" module defines an ""Impl"" module where all its exported functions are defined. `include NodeRe.Impl { type nonrec t = t };` means that all the functions in `NodeRe.Impl` should be included in this module, but with the `t` type of that module replaced by the `t` type of this one. And that's it, it now has all the functions.  Implementation inheritance is used instead of subtyping to make it easier to understand which functions operate on any given ""subject"". If you have an `element` and you need to use a function defined in `Node`, let's say `removeChild` you cannot just use `Node.removeChild`. Instead you need to use `Element.removeChild`, which you can since `Element` inherits from `Node`. As a general rule, always use the function in the module corresponding to the type you have. You'll find this makes it very easy to see what types you're dealing with just by reading the code."

[[1]](doc/benefits.md#simple-cli) - Python Fire is a helpful tool for developing and debugging Python code. [[2]](doc/benefits.md#debugging) - Python Fire helps with exploring existing code or turning other people's code into a CLI. [[3]](doc/benefits.md#exploring) - Python Fire makes transitioning between Bash and Python easier. [[4]](doc/benefits.md#bash) - Python Fire makes using a Python REPL easier by setting up the REPL with the modules and variables you'll need already imported and created. [[5]](doc/benefits.md#repl)  
3922,346,https://github.com/yaogdu/python-fire,## Installation,3,yaogdu.python-fire.md,2, `pip install fire`  
3923,346,https://github.com/yaogdu/python-fire,## Basic Usage,36,yaogdu.python-fire.md,2," You can call `Fire` on any Python object:<br> functions, classes, modules, objects, dictionaries, lists, tuples, etc. They all work!  Here's a simple example.  ```python import fire  class Calculator(object):   """"""A simple calculator class.""""""    def double(self, number):     return 2 * number  if __name__ == '__main__':   fire.Fire(Calculator) ```  Then, from the command line, you can run:  ```bash python calculator.py double 10  # 20 python calculator.py double --number=15  # 30 ```  To learn how Fire behaves on functions, objects, dicts, lists, etc, and to learn about Fire's other features, see the [Using a Fire CLI page](doc/using-cli.md).

You can update plugins, configure multisite installs and much more, without using a web browser.  For announcements, follow [@wpcli on Twitter](https://twitter.com/wpcli) or [sign up for our email newsletter](http://wp-cli.us13.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=0615e4d18f213891fc000adfd&id=8c61d7641e). [Check out the roadmap](https://wp-cli.org/docs/roadmap/) for an overview of what's planned for upcoming releases.  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wp-cli/wp-cli.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wp-cli/wp-cli) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/badges/github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli.svg)](https://gemnasium.com/github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli) [![Average time to resolve an issue](http://isitmaintained.com/badge/resolution/wp-cli/wp-cli.svg)](http://isitmaintained.com/project/wp-cli/wp-cli ""Average time to resolve an issue"") [![Percentage of issues still open](http://isitmaintained.com/badge/open/wp-cli/wp-cli.svg)](http://isitmaintained.com/project/wp-cli/wp-cli ""Percentage of issues still open"")  Quick links: [Using](#using) &#124; [Installing](#installing) &#124; [Support](#support) &#124; [Extending](#extending) &#124; [Contributing](#contributing) &#124; [Credits](#credits) "
3929,347,https://github.com/ocean90/wp-cli,## Using,3,ocean90.wp-cli.md,2," WP-CLI's goal is to provide a command-line interface for any action you might want to perform in the WordPress admin. For instance, `wp plugin install --activate` ([doc](https://wp-cli.org/commands/plugin/install/)) lets you install and activate a WordPress plugin:  ```bash $ wp plugin install rest-api --activate Installing WordPress REST API (Version 2) (2.0-beta13) Downloading install package from https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/rest-api.2.0-beta13.zip... Unpacking the package... Installing the plugin... Plugin installed successfully. Activating 'rest-api'... Success: Plugin 'rest-api' activated. ```  WP-CLI also includes commands for many things you can't do in the WordPress admin. For example, `wp transient delete --all` ([doc](https://wp-cli.org/commands/transient/delete/)) lets you delete one or all transients:  ```bash $ wp transient delete --all Success: 34 transients deleted from the database. ```  For a more complete introduction to using WP-CLI, read the [Quick Start guide](https://wp-cli.org/docs/quick-start/). Or, catch up with [shell friends](https://wp-cli.org/docs/shell-friends/) to learn about helpful command line utilities.  Already feel comfortable with the basics? Jump into the [complete list of commands](https://wp-cli.org/commands/) for detailed information on managing themes and plugins, importing and exporting data, performing database search-replace operations and more. "
3930,347,https://github.com/ocean90/wp-cli,## Installing,3,ocean90.wp-cli.md,2," Downloading the Phar file is our recommended installation method. Should you need, see also our documentation on [alternative installation methods](https://wp-cli.org/docs/installing/).  Before installing WP-CLI, please make sure your environment meets the minimum requirements:  - UNIX-like environment (OS X, Linux, FreeBSD, Cygwin); limited support in Windows environment - PHP 5.3.29 or later - WordPress 3.7 or later  Once you've verified requirements, download the [wp-cli.phar](https://raw.github.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar) file using `wget` or `curl`:  ```bash $ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar ```  Next, check if it is working:  ```bash $ php wp-cli.phar --info ```  To use WP-CLI from the command line by typing `wp`, make the file executable and move it to somewhere in your PATH. For example:  ```bash $ chmod +x wp-cli.phar $ sudo mv wp-cli.phar /usr/local/bin/wp ```  If WP-CLI was installed successfully, you should see something like this when you run `wp --info`:  ```bash $ wp --info PHP binary:    /usr/bin/php5 PHP version:    5.5.9-1ubuntu4.14 php.ini used:   /etc/php5/cli/php.ini WP-CLI root dir:        /home/wp-cli/.wp-cli WP-CLI packages dir:    /home/wp-cli/.wp-cli/packages/ WP-CLI global config:   /home/wp-cli/.wp-cli/config.yml WP-CLI project config: WP-CLI version: 1.0.0 ``` "
3931,347,https://github.com/ocean90/wp-cli,### Updating,3,ocean90.wp-cli.md,3," You can update WP-CLI with `wp cli update` ([doc](https://wp-cli.org/commands/cli/update/)), or by repeating the installation steps.  If WP-CLI is owned by root or another system user, you'll need to run `sudo wp cli update`.  Want to live life on the edge? Run `wp cli update --nightly` to use the latest nightly build of WP-CLI. The nightly build is more or less stable enough for you to use in your development environment, and always includes the latest and greatest WP-CLI features. "
3932,347,https://github.com/ocean90/wp-cli,### Tab completions,3,ocean90.wp-cli.md,3," WP-CLI also comes with a tab completion script for Bash and ZSH. Just download [wp-completion.bash](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/master/utils/wp-completion.bash) and source it from `~/.bash_profile`:  ```bash source /FULL/PATH/TO/wp-completion.bash ```  Don't forget to run `source ~/.bash_profile` afterwards.  If using zsh for your shell, you may need to load and start `bashcompinit` before sourcing. Put the following in your `.zshrc`:  ```bash autoload bashcompinit bashcompinit source /FULL/PATH/TO/wp-completion.bash ``` "
3933,347,https://github.com/ocean90/wp-cli,## Support,6,ocean90.wp-cli.md,2," WP-CLI's maintainers and project contributors are volunteers, and have limited availability to address general support questions. The [current version of WP-CLI](http://wp-cli.org/docs/roadmap/) is the only officially supported version.  When looking for support, please first look for an answer in one of the following resources:  - [Common issues and their fixes](https://wp-cli.org/docs/common-issues/) - [Documentation portal](https://wp-cli.org/docs/) - [Open or closed issues on Github](https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue) - [runcommand tips](https://runcommand.io/tips/) - [WordPress StackExchange forums](http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/wp-cli)  Need help with a project related to work? Professional users may want to consider [runcommand premium support](https://runcommand.io/pricing/). Alternatively, join the `#cli` channel on the [WordPress.org Slack organization](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/) to see if a community member might have an answer for you.  Github issues are meant for tracking enhancements and bugs of existing commands, not general support. Before submitting a bug report, please [review our best practices](https://wp-cli.org/docs/bug-reports/) to help ensure your issue is addressed in a timely manner.  Please do not ask support questions on Twitter. Twitter isn't an acceptable venue for support because: 1) it's hard to hold conversations in under 140 characters, and 2) Twitter isn't a place where someone with your same question can search for an answer in a prior conversation.  Remember, libre != gratis; the open source license grants you the freedom to use and modify, but not commitments of other people's time. Please be respectful, and set your expectations accordingly. "
3934,347,https://github.com/ocean90/wp-cli,## Extending,6,ocean90.wp-cli.md,2," A **command** is an atomic unit of WP-CLI functionality. `wp plugin install` ([doc](https://wp-cli.org/commands/plugin/install/)) is one command. `wp plugin activate` ([doc](https://wp-cli.org/commands/plugin/activate/)) is another.  WP-CLI supports registering any callable class, function, or closure as a command. It reads usage details from the callback's PHPdoc. `WP_CLI::add_command()` ([doc](https://wp-cli.org/docs/internal-api/wp-cli-add-command/)) is used for both internal and third-party command registration.  ```php /**  * Delete an option from the database.  *  * Returns an error if the option didn't exist.  *  * ## OPTIONS  *  * <key>  * : Key for the option.  *  * ## EXAMPLES  *  *     $ wp option delete my_option  *     Success: Deleted 'my_option' option.  */ $delete_option_cmd = function( $args ) { 	list( $key ) = $args;  	if ( ! delete_option( $key ) ) { 		WP_CLI::error( ""Could not delete '$key' option. Does it exist?"" ); 	} else { 		WP_CLI::success( ""Deleted '$key' option."" ); 	} }; WP_CLI::add_command( 'option delete', $delete_option_cmd ); ```  WP-CLI comes with dozens of commands. It's easier than it looks to create a custom WP-CLI command. Read the [commands cookbook](https://wp-cli.org/docs/commands-cookbook/) to learn more. Browse the [internal API docs](https://wp-cli.org/docs/internal-api/) to discover a variety of helpful functions you can use in your custom WP-CLI command. "

3955,350,https://github.com/juame/puppet-firewalld,## Description,1,juame.puppet-firewalld.md,2," This module manages firewalld, the userland interface that replaces iptables and ships with RHEL7.  The module manages firewalld itself as well as providing types and providers for managing firewalld zones and rich rules. "
3956,350,https://github.com/juame/puppet-firewalld,## Usage,3,juame.puppet-firewalld.md,2, The firewalld module contains types and providers to manage zones and rich rules by interfacing with the `firewall-cmd` command.  The following types are currently supported.  Note that all zone and rules management is done in `--permanent` mode. 
3957,350,https://github.com/juame/puppet-firewalld,### Firewalld Zones,3,juame.puppet-firewalld.md,3," Firewalld zones can be managed with the `firewalld_zone` resource type.  _Example_:  ```puppet   firewalld_zone { 'restricted':     ensure => present,     target => '%%REJECT%%',     purge_rich_rules => true,   } ``` "
3958,350,https://github.com/juame/puppet-firewalld,#### Parameters,3,juame.puppet-firewalld.md,4," * `target`: Specify the target of the zone * `purge_rich_rules`: Optional, and defaulted to false.  When true any configured rich rules found in the zone that do not match what is in the Puppet catalog will be purged. "
3959,350,https://github.com/juame/puppet-firewalld,### Firewalld rich rules,3,juame.puppet-firewalld.md,3," Firewalld rich rules are managed using the `firewalld_rich_rule` resource type  firewalld_rich_rules will `autorequire` the firewalld_zone specified in the `zone` parameter so there is no need to add dependancies for this  _Example_:  ```puppet   firewalld_rich_rule { 'Accept SSH from barny':     ensure => present,     zone   => 'restricted',     source => '192.168.1.2/32',     service => 'ssh',     action  => 'accept',   } ``` "
3960,350,https://github.com/juame/puppet-firewalld,#### Parameters,3,juame.puppet-firewalld.md,4," * `zone`: Name of the zone this rich rule belongs to  * `family`: Protocol family, defaults to `ipv4`  * `source`: Source address information. This can be a hash containing the keys `address` and `invert`, or a string containing just the IP address   ```puppet      source => '192.168.2.1',       source => { 'address' => '192.168.1.1', 'invert' => true }   ```  * `dest`: Source address information. This can be a hash containing the keys `address` and `invert`, or a string containing just the IP address   ```puppet      dest => '192.168.2.1',       dest => { 'address' => '192.168.1.1', 'invert' => true }   ```  * `log`: When set to `true` will enable logging, optionally this can be hash with `prefix`, `level` and `limit`   ```puppet      log => { 'level' => 'debug', 'prefix' => 'foo' },       log => true,   ```  * `audit`: When set to `true` will enable auditing, optionally this can be hash with `limit`   ```puppet      audit => { 'limit' => '3/s' },       audit => true,   ```  * `action`: A string containing the action `accept`, `reject` or `drop`.  For `reject` it can be optionally supplied as a hash containing `type`   ```puppet      action => 'accept'       action => { 'action' => 'reject', 'type' => 'bad' }   ```   The following paramters are the element of the rich rule, only _one_ may be used.  * `service`: Name of the service  * `port`: A hash containing `port` and `protocol` values   ```puppet      port => {        'port' => 80,        'protocol' => 'tcp',      },   ```  * `icmp_block`: Specify an `icmp-block` for the rule  * `masquerade`: Set to `true` or `false` to enable masquerading  * `forward_port`: Set forward-port, this should be a hash containing `port`,`protocol`,`to_port`,`to_addr`   ```puppet      forward_port => {        'port' => '8080',        'protocol' => 'tcp',        'to_addr' => '10.2.1.1',        'to_port' => '8993'      },   ``` "

It divides its cells into columns of days, with the size of each cell corresponding to its length. `MSCollectionViewCalendarLayout` is very similar to the ""Week"" view in the Apple Calendar/iCal app. See the example screenshots for what this looks like. "
3964,351,https://github.com/tetsuo6666/MSCollectionViewCalendarLayout,# UICollectionView?,126,tetsuo6666.MSCollectionViewCalendarLayout.md,1," `UICollectionView` is awesome. If you're unfamiliar, read Matt Thompson's [excellent article](http://nshipster.com/uicollectionview/) about them on [NSHipster](http://nshipster.com). Everyone should use them (yes, even instead of good ol' `UITableView`). This is especially true now that iOS 6+ adoption is [over 90%](http://david-smith.org/iosversionstats/) (As of March, 2013). It's the right thing to do.  Because of how awesome `UICollectionView` is, the `UIViewController` powering the below example is incredibly thin—only about *175 lines of code*, including whitespace. "
3965,351,https://github.com/tetsuo6666/MSCollectionViewCalendarLayout,# Example,3,tetsuo6666.MSCollectionViewCalendarLayout.md,1," The example project queries the [SeatGeek API](http://platform.seatgeek.com) for the next 1000 sport events near Denver, Colorado. It displays these events in a `UICollectionView` using `MSCollectionViewCalendarLayout`, mimicking the look and feel of the Apple Calendar iOS App. To run, build and run the `Example` target in from `Example.xcworkspace` within the `Example` directory.

3969,351,https://github.com/tetsuo6666/MSCollectionViewCalendarLayout,## Invalidating Layout,3,tetsuo6666.MSCollectionViewCalendarLayout.md,2," If you change the content of your `MSCollectionViewCalendarLayout`, make sure to call the `invalidateLayoutCache` method. This flushes the internal caches of your `MSCollectionViewCalendarLayout`, allowing the data to be repopulated correctly. "
3970,351,https://github.com/tetsuo6666/MSCollectionViewCalendarLayout,## Section Layouts,3,tetsuo6666.MSCollectionViewCalendarLayout.md,2," On the iPhone, `MSCollectionViewCalendarLayout` defaults to tiling its day sections vertically. The day column headers act as they do in a table view, sticking to the top until they're replaced by the next day's as your scroll. On the iPad, the day sections are tiled horizontally. This behavior is controlled by the `sectionLayoutType` property. Its values can be:  * `MSSectionLayoutTypeHorizontalTile` – Day sections tile vertically. * `MSSectionLayoutTypeVerticalTile` – Day sections tile horizontally. "
3971,351,https://github.com/tetsuo6666/MSCollectionViewCalendarLayout,## Collection View Elements,3,tetsuo6666.MSCollectionViewCalendarLayout.md,2," `MSCollectionViewCalendarLayout` has nine different elements that you should register `UICollectionReusableView` and `UICollectionViewCell` classes for. They are:  * **Event Cell** (`UICollectionViewCell`) – Represents your events. * **Day Column Header** (`UICollectionReusableView`) – Contains the day text, top aligned. * **Time Row Header** (`UICollectionReusableView`) – Contains the time text, left aligned. * **Day Column Header Background** (`UICollectionReusableView`) – Background of the day column header. * **Time Row Header Background** (`UICollectionReusableView`) – Background of the time row header. * **Current Time Indicator** (`UICollectionReusableView`) – Displayed over the time row header, aligned at the current time. * **Current Time Horizontal Gridline** (`UICollectionReusableView`) – Displayed under the cells, aligned to the current time. * **Horizontal Gridilne** (`UICollectionReusableView`) – Displayed under the cells, aligns with its corresponding time row header. * **Vertical Gridilne** (`UICollectionReusableView`) – Displayed under the cells, aligns with its corresponding day column header.  If you think there should be more of these, don't hesitate to add them in a pull request. To see how this is done, check the example. "

Milliseconds are exception - they are padded to four places and you have to pass four letters (`ssss`).  You can use every separator you want, but be careful. Passing format `h hours, m minutes` will produce unexpected results `34 34ours, 17 17inutes`. To avoid that, wrap every separator containing reserved letters in quotaion marks, like that `h 'hours', m 'minutes'`. (remember about escaping them in your code!). Now, the result should be nicely formatted `34 hours, 17 minutes`. "
3979,352,https://github.com/renoguyon/angular-duration-format,## Additional notes ##,3,renoguyon.angular-duration-format.md,2,"Note, that you can ommit some unit ""levels"", but it can produce weird results.

Includes a pretty comprihensive store set up. It migth have somes stuf we might not need, but good way to get familiar with commerce, how prodcuts (skus/variations) and product displays relate. Similiar model should be created in fitmoo. We should really just import the product variations. I also added stock module to /sites/all/modules/contrib  We will have to add more modules, for the API, Drupal Services and etc for API end points.  We could keep Kickstart as our base or just start with simple drupal and pick out modules we need.  Base db with sample content is in /db/fitmoo_store.sql "

4067,362,https://github.com/zephyrm/d3,## Installing,3,zephyrm.d3.md,2," If you use npm, `npm install d3`. Otherwise, download the [latest release](https://github.com/d3/d3/releases/latest). The released bundle supports anonymous AMD, CommonJS, and vanilla environments. You can load directly from [d3js.org](https://d3js.org), [CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/d3), or [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/d3/). For example:  ```html <script src=""https://d3js.org/d3.v4.js""></script> ```  For the minified version:  ```html <script src=""https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js""></script> ```  You can also use the standalone D3 microlibraries. For example, [d3-selection](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection):  ```html <script src=""https://d3js.org/d3-selection.v1.js""></script> ```  D3 is written using [ES2015 modules](http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html). Create a [custom bundle using Rollup](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/bb09af4c39c79cffcde4), Webpack, or your preferred bundler. To import D3 into an ES2015 application, either import specific symbols from specific D3 modules:  ```js import {scaleLinear} from ""d3-scale""; ```  Or import everything into a namespace (here, `d3`):  ```js import * as d3 from ""d3""; ```  In Node:  ```js var d3 = require(""d3""); ```  You can also require individual modules and combine them into a `d3` object using [Object.assign](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign):  ```js var d3 = Object.assign({}, require(""d3-format""), require(""d3-geo""), require(""d3-geo-projection"")); ```"

Add `-I gpfs/apps/hpc/Libs/Boost/1.59.0/include` to the line that begins with `INC :=` in the makefile.  * To create an executable, run the command:     ```     > make [clean] network     ```     * [clean] will delete the old executable. This is optional.  * You should now have an executable file called bin/afines. NOTE: you only need to recreate this file if you edit the source   code.  * Create an output directory for your simulation (not necessarily named ""out/test"") as well as the ""txt_stack"" and ""data""   directories (necessarily named ""txt_stack"" and ""data"") e.g. with the commands:  ``` > mkdir -p out/test/txt_stack > mkdir -p out/test/data ```  * Run your simulation in the specified output output directory, e.g.,     ```     > bin/afines --dir out/test     ```  * See below for other simulation configuration options that you can set from the command line or from a configuration   file  * Once your simulation has completed, the following files will have been generated:  * out/test/txt_stack/actins.txt //the trajectories of every actin bead  * out/test/txt_stack/links.txt //the trajectories of every link  * out/test/txt_stack/amotors.txt //the trajectories of all active motors (e.g., myosin) at every time step  * out/test/txt_stack/pmotors.txt //the trajectories of all passive motors (e.g., crosslinkers) at every time step  * out/test/data/thermo.txt //the energies of actin filaments  * out/test/data/output.txt //some metadata about the simulation  All files are tab delimited  * txt_stack/actins.txt has the format      * x y r idx         * (x, y)  = bead position,         * r  = bead radius         * idx = index of filament that the bead is on  * txt_stack/links.txt has the format      * x y dx dy idx          * (x, y) = end position of link closer to the barbed end of filament          * (x + dx, y + dy) = end position of link farther from barbed end          * idx = index of filament the link is on  * txt_stack/amotors.txt and txt_stack/pmotors.txt have the format     * x y dx dy fidx0 fidx1 lidx0 lidx1         * (x, y) = position of head 0 of motor         * (x + dx, y + dy) = position of head 1 of motor         * fidx0 = index of filament that head 0 is attached to (-1 if not attached)         * fidx1 = index of filament that head 1 is attached to (-1 if not attached)         * lidx0 = index of link that head 0 is attached to (-1 if fidx0 = -1)         * lidx1 = index of link that head 1 is attached to (-1 if fidx1 = -1)  * data/thermo.txt has the format     * KE PE TE idx         * KE = total v^2 of filament         * PE = total potential energy of filament         * TE = KE + PE         * idx = filament index  The time associated with the positions/energies is on it's own line before each list of positions within the file.

4082,365,https://github.com/bambella4316/javascript-arithmetic-lab-bootcamp-prep-000,## Introduction,1,bambella4316.javascript-arithmetic-lab-bootcamp-prep-000.md,2," In this lab, we're going to practice writing functions and manipulating numbers in JavaScript. First, though, we need to go over some basic math. In this lab, we're going to learn about various arithmetic operators. What's an operator, you say? It's a symbol that _operates_ on one or more (usually two) objects — `+` is a good example. The `+` operator says ""add what's to the left of `+` and what's to the right of `+` together."" Easy-peasy!  As you read through this lesson, you're going to be adding your solutions to `index.js`. You'll write a total of eight functions; use the results of running `learn test` in your IDE to guide you towards the right function names and functionality. "
4083,365,https://github.com/bambella4316/javascript-arithmetic-lab-bootcamp-prep-000,## Basic Math,3,bambella4316.javascript-arithmetic-lab-bootcamp-prep-000.md,2," The most fundamental math operations work as one might expect in JavaScript: `+` adds two numbers; `-` subtracts one number from another; `*` multiplies two numbers; and `/` divides one number by another. For example (as usual, follow along in console!)  ``` javascript 1 + 80 // 81 60 - 40 // 20 2 * 3.4 // 6.8 (there's that floating-point arithmetic again...) 5.0 / 2.5 // 2 ```  At this point, we can fix the first _four_ broken tests: we can define functions `add()`, `subtract()`, `multiply()`, `divide()` in `index.js`. "
4084,365,https://github.com/bambella4316/javascript-arithmetic-lab-bootcamp-prep-000,## Math + Assignment,36,bambella4316.javascript-arithmetic-lab-bootcamp-prep-000.md,2," Additionally, we can increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) a number if it's assigned to a variable:  ``` javascript var number = 5  number++ // 5... hmmmm  number // 6 -- the number was incremented after it was evaluated  number-- // 6  number // 5 ```  We can also put the incrementor and decrementor operations before the number:  ``` javascript --number // 4  ++number // 5 ```  But generally, you will see them placed _after_ the number (and we recommend that that's where you put them). If you're interested in the difference, take a look [here](http://jsforallof.us/2014/07/10/pre-increment-vs-post-increment/)  And, while we're on the subject, you'll usually only want to use these incrementors and decrementors when the shorthand makes what you're writing easier to read (more on when _exactly_ later). Instead, it's best to use the basic arithmetic operators combined with `=`. For the examples below, assume that `number` is equal to `5` (and resets for every example).  - `+=` modifies the value to the operator's left by adding to it the value to the operator's right:  ```javascript number += 3 // 8 ```  - `-=` modifies the value to the operator's left by subtracting from it the value to the operator's right:  ``` javascript number -= 2 // 3 ```  - `*=` modifies the value to the operator's left by multiplying it by the value to the operator's right:  ``` javascript number *= 10 // 50 ```  - `/=` modifies the value to the operator's left by dividing it by the value to the operator's right:  ``` javascript number /= 5 // 1 ```  The thing to remember about these methods is that they modify the variable in place. So if we have two functions that depend on the same external variable, the order in which they're called matters. Follow along in console:  ``` javascript var number = 10  function add5() {   number += 5 }  function divideBy3() {   number /= 3 }  divideBy3()  console.log(number) // 3.333333333335  add5()  console.log(number) // 8.333333333335  // reset number number = 10  add5()  console.log(number) // 15  divideBy3()  console.log(number) // 5 ```  **Because these methods are more explicit, prefer `+=` to `++` and `-=` to `--` (usually).**  Okay, now we're ready to write solutions for the next two functions: `inc(n)` and `dec(n)`. "
4085,365,https://github.com/bambella4316/javascript-arithmetic-lab-bootcamp-prep-000,## Parsing Numbers,3,bambella4316.javascript-arithmetic-lab-bootcamp-prep-000.md,2," Sometimes, we'll receive a number — well, we know it's a number, as we've seen many numbers in the past. JavaScript, however, won't know that it's a number because it shows up wrapped in quotes — JavaScript, then, thinks it's a string.  Luckily, JavaScript gives us tools to turn these strings into proper numbers (that is, numbers that JavaScript understands). "
4086,365,https://github.com/bambella4316/javascript-arithmetic-lab-bootcamp-prep-000,### `parseInt()`,3,bambella4316.javascript-arithmetic-lab-bootcamp-prep-000.md,3," The first such tool is the function `parseInt()`, which accepts two arguments: the value to parse and the base of the value being parsed. _Usually_ you will want to work with base 10, so a typical call to `parseInt()` looks like  ``` javascript parseInt('2', 10) // 2 ```  What happens if we pass a representation of a non-integer to `parseInt()`? Let's try it:  ``` javascript parseInt('2.2222', 10) ```  If we enter the above in console, we'll see that `parseInt()` forces the parsed number to be an integer — which makes sense when we think about it, right?  What happens, though, if we pass utter nonsense to `parseInt()`? Go ahead and try it in the console — something like  ``` javascript parseInt('nonsense!', 10) ```  What did it return? `NaN`? What is that?  `NaN` stands for ""not a number"" — pretty handy, right? This is the number (in the JavaScript sense) that JavaScript returns when it can't determine a valid value for a numeric operation. "
4087,365,https://github.com/bambella4316/javascript-arithmetic-lab-bootcamp-prep-000,### `parseFloat()`,3,bambella4316.javascript-arithmetic-lab-bootcamp-prep-000.md,3," Above, we saw that `parseInt()` lops off everything after the decimal point and only returns integers. If we want to preserve decimals, we'll need to use `parseFloat()`.  Unlike `parseInt()`, `parseFloat()` accepts only a single argument, the thing to be parsed. We can use it like so:  ``` javascript parseFloat('80.123999') // 80.123999 ```  You're now ready to solve the final two tests in this lab, `makeInt(n)` and `preserveDecimal(n)`.  "

4090,366,https://github.com/leobcn/takeown,## INTRO,1,leobcn.takeown.md,2,"-----  `takeown` allows administrators to delegate taking ownersip ownership of files and directories to non-administrators.  It uses the set-uid bit to gain the necessary privileges to do so.  Example: the administrator wants to let the user `pablo` take over ownership of files in `/var/shared/Incoming`.  To that effect, the administrator runs:      takeown -a pablo /var/shared/Incoming  Once he has done so, the user `pablo` can run the command:      takeown /var/shared/Incoming/some-file.txt  and `takeown` will change the owner of the file `some-file.txt` to `pablo`.  Each delegation is recorded in a file `.takeown.delegations` stored in the root directory of the volume containing the delegated file / directory.  Delegations recorded on a volume only apply to files and directories stored in the volume.  Delegations do not propagate across mount points. If a user has been granted a delegation on a directory, he will be authorized to take ownership of any files contained in that directory, so long as said files are in the same volume.  The flag `-r` in the takeown command induces takeown to grant ownership to the invoking user recursively across all files and subdirectories of the specified paths.  The caveat about not crossing mount points applies -- if another volume is mounted within the path specified to a `takeown -r` command, that volume will be skipped silently.  For security reasons, attempts by an authorized user to take ownership of a volume or ownership of the delegation record file will be silently ignored. "
4091,366,https://github.com/leobcn/takeown,## DELEGATING OWNERSHIP TO AN USER,3,leobcn.takeown.md,2,"-------------------------------  To allow a user to take ownership of files under a directory, or specific files, run:      takeown username /path/to/directory/or/file...  This will delegate the taking of ownership to the user, allowing him to run `takeown` to take ownership of any file within the specified paths.  WARNING: if you delegate the taking of ownership of a volume to a user, that user may take ownership of the volume itself, and then remove the delegation store.  This is not a security issue -- it does not grant the user any extra privileges -- but it does prevent future uses of `takeown` by unprivileged users in that volume. "
4092,366,https://github.com/leobcn/takeown,## REVOKING DELEGATIONS,3,leobcn.takeown.md,2,"--------------------  To revoke an established delegation, use the following command:      takeown -d username /delegated/path  This removes the specific delegation established for that user name. "
4093,366,https://github.com/leobcn/takeown,## LISTING DELEGATIONS,3,leobcn.takeown.md,2,"-------------------  Any user may list established delegations with the command:      takeown -l [PATH]  However, only the administrator may list delegations for all users.  Other users will only get to see the delegations assigned to him. "
4094,366,https://github.com/leobcn/takeown,## SIMULATING TAKING OWNERSHIP,3,leobcn.takeown.md,2,"---------------------------  The action of taking ownership can be simulated with flag `-s`.  In this mode, `takeown` will print what it would do rather than changing the file system. "
4095,366,https://github.com/leobcn/takeown,## TRACING,3,leobcn.takeown.md,2,"-------  If a file `/.trace` exists in the root directory, the user is allowed to specify the flag `-T`, which causes the program to print tracing information, useful to debug problems with the program. "

In a hypothetical scenario where the desired attack rate is 60k requests per second, let's assume we have 3 machines with `vegeta` installed.  Make sure open file descriptor and process limits are set to a high number for your user **on each machine** using the `ulimit` command.  We're ready to start the attack. All we need to do is to divide the intended rate by the number of machines, and use that number on each attack. Here we'll use [pdsh](https://code.google.com/p/pdsh/) for orchestration.  ```shell $ pdsh -b -w '10.0.1.1,10.0.2.1,10.0.3.1' \     'echo ""GET http://target/"" | vegeta attack -rate=20000 -duration=60s > result.bin' ```  After the previous command finishes, we can gather the result files to use on our report.  ```shell $ for machine in ""10.0.1.1 10.0.2.1 10.0.3.1""; do     scp $machine:~/result.bin $machine.bin &   done ```  The `report` command accepts multiple result files in a comma separated list. It'll read and sort them by timestamp before generating reports.  ```console $ vegeta report -inputs=""10.0.1.1.bin,10.0.2.1.bin,10.0.3.1.bin"" Requests      [total, rate]         3600000, 60000.00 Latencies     [mean, 95, 99, max]   223.340085ms, 326.913687ms, 416.537743ms, 7.788103259s Bytes In      [total, mean]         3714690, 3095.57 Bytes Out     [total, mean]         0, 0.00 Success       [ratio]               100.0% Status Codes  [code:count]          200:3600000 Error Set: ``` "

You might have troubles with sections heights otherwise. The examples provided use HTML 5 doctype `<!DOCTYPE html>`.  Each section will be defined with an element containing the `section` class. The active section by default will be the first section, which is taken as the home page.  Sections should be placed inside a wrapper (`<div id=""fullpage"">` in this case). The wrapper can not be the `body` element. ```html <div id=""fullpage""> 	<div class=""section"">Some section</div> 	<div class=""section"">Some section</div> 	<div class=""section"">Some section</div> 	<div class=""section"">Some section</div> </div> ``` If you want to define a different starting point rather than the first section or the first slide of a section, just add the class `active` to the section and slide you want to load first. ```html <div class=""section active"">Some section</div> ```  In order to create a landscape slider within a section, each slide will be defined by default with an element containing the `slide` class: ```html <div class=""section""> 	<div class=""slide""> Slide 1 </div> 	<div class=""slide""> Slide 2 </div> 	<div class=""slide""> Slide 3 </div> 	<div class=""slide""> Slide 4 </div> </div> ```` You can see a fully working example of the HTML structure in the [`demoPage.html` file](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/blob/master/examples/demoPage.html). "
4157,369,https://github.com/monkeymoney/fullPage.js,###Initialization,3,monkeymoney.fullPage.js.md,3,"All you need to do is call the plugin inside a `$(document).ready` function:  ```javascript $(document).ready(function() { 	$('#fullpage').fullpage(); }); ```  A more complex initialization with all options set could look like this: ```javascript $(document).ready(function() { 	$('#fullpage').fullpage({ 		//Navigation 		menu: '#menu', 		lockAnchors: false, 		anchors:['firstPage', 'secondPage'], 		navigation: false, 		navigationPosition: 'right', 		navigationTooltips: ['firstSlide', 'secondSlide'], 		showActiveTooltip: false, 		slidesNavigation: true, 		slidesNavPosition: 'bottom',  		//Scrolling 		css3: true, 		scrollingSpeed: 700, 		autoScrolling: true, 		fitToSection: true, 		fitToSectionDelay: 1000, 		scrollBar: false, 		easing: 'easeInOutCubic', 		easingcss3: 'ease', 		loopBottom: false, 		loopTop: false, 		loopHorizontal: true, 		continuousVertical: false, 		continuousHorizontal: false, 		scrollHorizontally: false, 		interlockedSlides: false, 		dragAndMove: false, 		offsetSections: false, 		resetSliders: false, 		fadingEffect: false, 		normalScrollElements: '#element1, .element2', 		scrollOverflow: false, 		scrollOverflowOptions: null, 		touchSensitivity: 15, 		normalScrollElementTouchThreshold: 5, 		bigSectionsDestination: null,  		//Accessibility 		keyboardScrolling: true, 		animateAnchor: true, 		recordHistory: true,  		//Design 		controlArrows: true, 		verticalCentered: true, 		sectionsColor : ['#ccc', '#fff'], 		paddingTop: '3em', 		paddingBottom: '10px', 		fixedElements: '#header, .footer', 		responsiveWidth: 0, 		responsiveHeight: 0, 		responsiveSlides: false,  		//Custom selectors 		sectionSelector: '.section', 		slideSelector: '.slide',  		lazyLoading: true,  		//events 		onLeave: function(index, nextIndex, direction){}, 		afterLoad: function(anchorLink, index){}, 		afterRender: function(){}, 		afterResize: function(){}, 		afterResponsive: function(isResponsive){}, 		afterSlideLoad: function(anchorLink, index, slideAnchor, slideIndex){}, 		onSlideLeave: function(anchorLink, index, slideIndex, direction, nextSlideIndex){} 	}); }); ``` "
4158,369,https://github.com/monkeymoney/fullPage.js,### Creating links to sections or slides,3,monkeymoney.fullPage.js.md,3,"If you are using fullPage.js with anchor links for the sections (using the `anchors` option or the attribute `data-anchor` in each section), then you will be able to use anchor links also to navigate directly to a certain slide inside a section.  This would be an example of a link with an anchor: http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/#secondPage/2 (which is the URL you will see once you access to that section/slide manually) Notice the last part of the URL ends in `#secondPage/2`.  Having the following initialization:  ```javascript $(document).ready(function() { 	$('#fullpage').fullpage({ 		anchors:['firstPage', 'secondPage', 'thirdPage'] 	}); }); ```  The anchor at the end of the URL `#secondPage/2` defines the section and slide of destination respectively. In the previous URL, the section of destination will be the one defined with the anchor `secondPage` and the slide will be the 2nd slide, as we are using the index `2` for it. (the fist slide of a section has index 0, as technically it is a section).  We could have used a custom anchor for the slide instead of its index if we would have used the attribute `data-anchor` on the HTML markup like so:  ```html <div class=""section""> 	<div class=""slide"" data-anchor=""slide1""> Slide 1 </div> 	<div class=""slide"" data-anchor=""slide2""> Slide 2 </div> 	<div class=""slide"" data-anchor=""slide3""> Slide 3 </div> 	<div class=""slide"" data-anchor=""slide4""> Slide 4 </div> </div> ``` In this last case, the URL we would use would be `#secondPage/slide3`, which is the equivalent to our previous `#secondPage/2`.  Note that section anchors can also be defined in the same way, by using the `data-anchor` attribute, if no `anchors` array is provided.  **Be careful!** `data-anchor` tags can not have the same value as any ID element on the site (or NAME element for IE). "
4159,369,https://github.com/monkeymoney/fullPage.js,### Creating smaller or bigger sections,3,monkeymoney.fullPage.js.md,3,"[Demo](http://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/BKjRYm) fullPage.js provides a way to remove the full height restriction from its sections and slides. It is possible to create sections which height is smaller or bigger than the viewport. This is ideal for footers. It is important to realise that it doesn't make sense to have all of your sections using this feature. If there is more than one section in the initial load of the site, the plugin won't scroll at all to see the next one as it will be already in the viewport.  To create smaller sections just use the class `fp-auto-height` in the section you want to apply it. It will then take the height defined by your section/slide content.  ```html <div class=""section"">Whole viewport</div> <div class=""section fp-auto-height"">Auto height</div> ``` "
4160,369,https://github.com/monkeymoney/fullPage.js,#### Responsive auto height sections,3,monkeymoney.fullPage.js.md,4,A responsive auto height can be applied by using the class `fp-auto-height-responsive`. This way sections will be full height until the responsive mode gets fired. 
4161,369,https://github.com/monkeymoney/fullPage.js,### State classes added by fullpage.js,3,monkeymoney.fullPage.js.md,3,Fullpage.js adds multiple classes in different elements to keep a record of the status of the site:  - `active` is added the current visible section and slide. - `active` is added to the current menu element (if using the `menu` option). - A class of the form `fp-viewing-SECTION-SLIDE` is added to the `body` element of the site. (eg: [`fp-viewing-secondPage-0`](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/#secondPage)) The `SECTION` and `SLIDE` parts will be the anchors (or indexes if no anchor is provided) of the current section and slide. - `fp-responsive` is added to the `body` element when the entering in the responsive mode - `fp-enabled` is added to the `html` element when fullpage.js is enabled. (and removed when destroyed). - `fp-destroyed` is added to the fullpage.js container when the plugin is destroyed. - `fp-enabled` is added to the `html` element once the libary is initalized. 
4162,369,https://github.com/monkeymoney/fullPage.js,###Lazy Loading,3,monkeymoney.fullPage.js.md,3,"[Demo](http://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/eNLBXo) fullPage.js provides a way to lazy load images, videos and audio elements so they won't slow down the loading of your site or unnecessarily waste data transfer. When using lazy loading, all these elements will only get loaded when entering in the viewport. To enable lazy loading all you need to do is change your `src` attribute to `data-src` as shown below:  ``` <img data-src=""image.png""> <video> 	<source data-src=""video.webm"" type=""video/webm"" /> 	<source data-src=""video.mp4"" type=""video/mp4"" /> </video>  ```  If you already use another lazy load solution which uses `data-src` as well, you can disable the fullPage.js lazy loading by setting the option `lazyLoading: false`.

4164,369,https://github.com/monkeymoney/fullPage.js,#### Play on section/slide load:,3,monkeymoney.fullPage.js.md,4,"Using the attribute `autoplay` for videos or audio, or the param `autoplay=1` for youtube iframes will result in the media element playing on page load. In order to play it on section/slide load use instead the attribute `data-autoplay`. For example:  ```html <audio data-autoplay> 	<source src=""http://metakoncept.hr/horse.ogg"" type=""audio/ogg""> </audio> ``` "
4165,369,https://github.com/monkeymoney/fullPage.js,#### Pause on leave,3,monkeymoney.fullPage.js.md,4,"Embedded HTML5 `<video>` / `<audio>`  and Youtube iframes are automatically paused when you navigate away from a section or slide.

4166,369,https://github.com/monkeymoney/fullPage.js,###Use extensions,36,monkeymoney.fullPage.js.md,3,"fullpage.js [provides a set of extensions](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/extensions/) you can use to enhance its default features. All of them are listed as [fullpage.js options](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js#options).  Extensions requires you to use the minified file `jquery.fullpage.extensions.min.js` instead of the usual fullPage.js file (`jquery.fullpage.js`). Once you adquire the extension file, you will need to add it before fullPage.js. For example:  ```html <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""fullpage.continuousHorizontal.min.js""></script> <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""fullpage/jquery.fullpage.extensions.min.js""></script> ```  A license key will be required for each extension. [See more details about it here](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/wiki/How-to-activate-a-fullPage.js-extension).  Then you will be able to use and configure them as explained in [options](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js#options). "
4167,369,https://github.com/monkeymoney/fullPage.js,## Options,3,monkeymoney.fullPage.js.md,2," - `controlArrows`: (default `true`) Determines whether to use control arrows for the slides to move right or left.  - `verticalCentered`: (default `true`) Vertically centering of the content within sections. When set to `true`, your content will be wrapped by the plugin. Consider using delegation or load your other scripts in the `afterRender` callback.  - `scrollingSpeed`: (default `700`) Speed in milliseconds for the scrolling transitions.  - `sectionsColor`: (default `none`) Define the CSS `background-color` property for each section. Example: ```javascript $('#fullpage').fullpage({ 	sectionsColor: ['#f2f2f2', '#4BBFC3', '#7BAABE', 'whitesmoke', '#000'], }); ```  - `anchors`: (default `[]`) Defines the anchor links (#example) to be shown on the URL for each section. Anchors value should be unique. The position of the anchors in the array will define to which sections the anchor is applied. (second position for second section and so on). Using anchors forward and backward navigation will also be possible through the browser. This option also allows users to bookmark a specific section or slide. **Be careful!** anchors can not have the same value as any ID element on the site (or NAME element for IE). Now anchors can be defined directly in the HTML structure by using the attribute `data-anchor` as explained here.  - `lockAnchors`: (default `false`) Determines whether anchors in the URL will have any effect at all in the plugin. You can still using anchors internally for your own functions and callbacks, but they won't have any effect in the scrolling of the site. Useful if you want to combine fullPage.js with other plugins using anchor in the URL.  **Important** It is helpful to understand that the values in the `anchors` option array correlate directly to the element with the class of `.section` by it's position in the markup.  - `easing`: (default `easeInOutCubic`) Defines the transition effect to use for the vertical and horizontal scrolling. It requires the file `vendors/jquery.easings.min.js` or [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) for using some of [its transitions](http://api.jqueryui.com/easings/). Other libraries could be used instead.  - `easingcss3`: (default `ease`) Defines the transition effect to use in case of using `css3:true`. You can use the [pre-defined ones](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_transition-timing-function.asp) (such as `linear`, `ease-out`...) or create your own ones using the `cubic-bezier` function. You might want to use [Matthew Lein CSS Easing Animation Tool](http://matthewlein.com/ceaser/) for it.  - `loopTop`: (default `false`) Defines whether scrolling up in the first section should scroll to the last one or not.  - `loopBottom`: (default `false`) Defines whether scrolling down in the last section should scroll to the first one or not.  - `loopHorizontal`: (default `true`) Defines whether horizontal sliders will loop after reaching the last or previous slide or not.  - `css3`: (default `true`). Defines whether to use JavaScript or CSS3 transforms to scroll within sections and slides. Useful to speed up the movement in tablet and mobile devices with browsers supporting CSS3. If this option is set to `true` and the browser doesn't support CSS3, a jQuery fallback will be used instead.  - `autoScrolling`: (default `true`) Defines whether to use the ""automatic"" scrolling or the ""normal"" one. It also has affects the way the sections fit in the browser/device window in tablets and mobile phones.  - `fitToSection`: (default `true`) Determines whether or not to fit sections to the viewport or not. When set to `true` the current active section will always fill the whole viewport. Otherwise the user will be free to stop in the middle of a section (when )  - `fitToSectionDelay`: (default 1000). If `fitToSection` is set to true, this delays the fitting by the configured milliseconds.  - `scrollBar`: (default `false`) Determines whether to use scrollbar for the site or not. In case of using scroll bar, the `autoScrolling` functionality will still work as expected. The user will also be free to scroll the site with the scroll bar and fullPage.js will fit the section in the screen when scrolling finishes.  - `paddingTop`: (default `0`) Defines the top padding for each section with a numerical value and its measure (paddingTop: '10px', paddingTop: '10em'...) Useful in case of using a fixed header.  - `paddingBottom`: (default `0`) Defines the bottom padding for each section with a numerical value and its measure (paddingBottom: '10px', paddingBottom: '10em'...). Useful in case of using a fixed footer.  - `fixedElements`: (default `null`) Defines which elements will be taken off the scrolling structure of the plugin which is necessary when using the `css3` option to keep them fixed. It requires a string with the jQuery selectors for those elements. (For example: `fixedElements: '#element1, .element2'`)  - `normalScrollElements`: (default `null`) If you want to avoid the auto scroll when scrolling over some elements, this is the option you need to use. (useful for maps, scrolling divs etc.) It requires a string with the jQuery selectors for those elements. (For example: `normalScrollElements: '#element1, .element2'`). This option should not be applied to any section/slide element itself.  - `normalScrollElementTouchThreshold` : (default `5`) Defines the threshold for the number of hops up the html node tree Fullpage will test to see if `normalScrollElements` is a match to allow scrolling functionality on divs on a touch device. (For example: `normalScrollElementTouchThreshold: 3`)  - `bigSectionsDestination`: (default `null`) Defines how to scroll to a section which size is bigger than the viewport. By default fullPage.js scrolls to the top if you come from a section above the destination one and to the bottom if you come from a section below the destination one. Possible values are `top`, `bottom`, `null`.  - `keyboardScrolling`: (default `true`) Defines if the content can be navigated using the keyboard.  - `touchSensitivity`: (default `5`) Defines a percentage of the browsers window width/height, and how far a swipe must measure for navigating to the next section / slide  - `continuousVertical`: (default `false`) Defines whether scrolling down in the last section or should scroll down to the first one and if scrolling up in the first section should scroll up to the last one. Not compatible with `loopTop`, `loopBottom` or any scroll bar present in the site (`scrollBar:true` or `autoScrolling:false`).  - `continuousHorizontal`: (default `false`) [Extension of fullpage.js](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/extensions/). Defines whether sliding right in the last slide should slide right to the first one or not, and if scrolling left in the first slide should slide left to the last one or not. Not compatible with `loopHorizontal`. Requires fullpage.js >= 2.8.3.  - `scrollHorizontally`: (default `false`) [Extension of fullpage.js](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/extensions/). Defines whether to slide horizontally within sliders by using the mouse wheel or trackpad. Ideal for story telling`. Requires fullpage.js >= 2.8.3.  - `interlockedSlides`: (default `false`) [Extension of fullpage.js](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/extensions/). Determines whether moving one horizontal slider will force the sliding of sliders in other section in the same direction. Possible values are `true`, `false` or an array with the interlocked sections. For example `[1,3,5]` starting by 1. Requires fullpage.js >= 2.8.3.  - `dragAndMove`: (default `false`) [Extension of fullpage.js](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/extensions/). Enables or disables the dragging and flicking of sections and slides by using mouse or fingers. Possible values are `true`, `false`, `fingersonly`. Requires fullPage.js >= 2.8.9.  - `offsetSections`: (default `false`)[Extension of fullpage.js](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/extensions/). Provides a way to use non full screen sections based on percentage. Ideal to show visitors there's more content in the site by showing part of the next or previous section. Requires fullPage.js >= 2.8.8 To define the percentage of each section the attribute `data-percentage` must be used. The centering of the section in the viewport can be determined by using a boolean value in the attribute `data-centered` (default to `true` if not specified). For example: ``` html     <div class=""section"" data-percentage=""80"" data-centered=""true""> ```  - `resetSliders`: (default `false`). [Extension of fullpage.js](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/extensions/). Defines whether or not to reset every slider after leaving its section. Requires fullpage.js >= 2.8.3.  - `fadingEffect`: (default `false`). [Extension of fullpage.js](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/extensions/). Defines whether to use a fading effect or not instead of the default scrolling one. Possible values are `true`, `false`, `sections`, `slides`. It can therefore be applied just vertically or horizontally, or to both at the time. Requires fullpage.js >= 2.8.6.  - `animateAnchor`: (default `true`) Defines whether the load of the site when given an anchor (#) will scroll with animation to its destination or will directly load on the given section.  - `recordHistory`: (default `true`) Defines whether to push the state of the site to the browser's history. When set to `true` each section/slide of the site will act as a new page and the back and forward buttons of the browser will scroll the sections/slides to reach the previous or next state of the site. When set to `false`, the URL will keep changing but will have no effect ont he browser's history. This option is automatically turned off when using `autoScrolling:false`.  - `menu`: (default `false`) A selector can be used to specify the menu to link with the sections. This way the scrolling of the sections will activate the corresponding element in the menu using the class `active`. This won't generate a menu but will just add the `active` class to the element in the given menu with the corresponding anchor links. In order to link the elements of the menu with the sections, an HTML 5 data-tag (`data-menuanchor`) will be needed to use with the same anchor links as used within the sections. Example: ```html <ul id=""myMenu""> 	<li data-menuanchor=""firstPage"" class=""active""><a href=""#firstPage"">First section</a></li> 	<li data-menuanchor=""secondPage""><a href=""#secondPage"">Second section</a></li> 	<li data-menuanchor=""thirdPage""><a href=""#thirdPage"">Third section</a></li> 	<li data-menuanchor=""fourthPage""><a href=""#fourthPage"">Fourth section</a></li> </ul> ``` ```javascript $('#fullpage').fullpage({ 	anchors: ['firstPage', 'secondPage', 'thirdPage', 'fourthPage', 'lastPage'], 	menu: '#myMenu' }); ```  **Note:** the menu element should be placed outside the fullpage wrapper in order to avoid problem when using `css3:true`. Otherwise it will be appended to the `body` by the plugin itself.  - `navigation`: (default `false`) If set to `true`, it will show a navigation bar made up of small circles.  - `navigationPosition`: (default `none`) It can be set to `left` or `right` and defines which position the navigation bar will be shown (if using one).  - `navigationTooltips`: (default []) Defines the tooltips to show for the navigation circles in case they are being used. Example: `navigationTooltips: ['firstSlide', 'secondSlide']`. You can also define them by using the attribute `data-tooltip` in each section if you prefer.  - `showActiveTooltip`: (default `false`) Shows a persistent tooltip for the actively viewed section in the vertical navigation.  - `slidesNavigation`: (default `false`) If set to `true` it will show a navigation bar made up of small circles for each landscape slider on the site.  - `slidesNavPosition`: (default `bottom`) Defines the position for the landscape navigation bar for sliders. Admits `top` and `bottom` as values. You may want to modify the CSS styles to determine the distance from the top or bottom as well as any other style such as color.  - `scrollOverflow`: (default `false`) defines whether or not to create a scroll for the section/slide in case its content is bigger than the height of it. When set to `true`, your content will be wrapped by the plugin. Consider using delegation or load your other scripts in the `afterRender` callback. In case of setting it to `true`, it requires the vendor library [`scrolloverflow.min.js`](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/blob/master/vendors/scrolloverflow.min.js) and it should be loaded before the fullPage.js plugin. For example:  ```html <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""vendors/scrolloverflow.min.js""></script> <script type=""text/javascript"" src=""jquery.fullPage.js""></script> ```  In order to prevent fullpage.js from creating the scrollbar in certain sections or slides use the class `fp-noscroll`. For example: `<div class=""section fp-noscroll"">`  - `scrollOverflowOptions`: when using scrollOverflow:true fullpage.js will make use of a forked and modified version of [iScroll.js libary](https://github.com/cubiq/iscroll/). You can customize the scrolling behaviour by providing fullpage.js with the iScroll.js options you want to use. Check [its documentation](http://iscrolljs.com/) for more info.  - `sectionSelector`: (default `.section`) Defines the jQuery selector used for the plugin sections. It might need to be changed sometimes to avoid problem with other plugins using the same selectors as fullpage.js.  - `slideSelector`: (default `.slide`)  Defines the jQuery selector used for the plugin slides.  It might need to be changed sometimes to avoid problem with other plugins using the same selectors as fullpage.js.  - `responsiveWidth`: (default `0`)  A normal scroll (`autoScrolling:false`) will be used under the defined width in pixels. A class `fp-responsive` is added to the body tag in case the user wants to use it for his own responsive CSS. For example, if set to 900, whenever the browser's width is less than 900 the plugin will scroll like a normal site.  - `responsiveHeight`: (default `0`)  A normal scroll (`autoScrolling:false`) will be used under the defined height in pixels. A class `fp-responsive` is added to the body tag in case the user wants to use it for his own responsive CSS. For example, if set to 900, whenever the browser's height is less than 900 the plugin will scroll like a normal site.  - `responsiveSlides`: (default `false`) [Extension of fullpage.js](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/extensions/). When set to `true` slides will be turned into vertical sections when responsive mode is fired. (by using the `responsiveWidth` or `responsiveHeight` options detailed above). Requires fullpage.js >= 2.8.5.  - `lazyLoading`: (default `true`) Lazy loading is active by default which means it will lazy load any media element containing the attribute `data-src` as detailed in the [Lazy Loading docs](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js#lazy-loading) . If you want to use any other lazy loading library you can disable this fullpage.js feature. "

4236,370,https://github.com/dxas90/ionic-cli,## Icon and Splash Screen Image Generation,3,dxas90.ionic-cli.md,2," [Automatically generate icons and splash screens](http://ionicframework.com/blog/automating-icons-and-splash-screens/) from source images to create each size needed for each platform, in addition to copying each resized and cropped image into each platform's resources directory. Source images can either be a `png`, `psd` __Photoshop__ or `ai` __Illustrator__ file. Images are generated using Ionic's image resizing and cropping server, instead of requiring special libraries and plugins to be installed locally.  Since each platform has different image requirements, it's best to make a source image for the largest size needed, and let the CLI do all the resizing, cropping and copying for you. Newly generated images will be placed in the `resources` directory at the root of the Cordova project. Additionally, the CLI will update and add the correct `<platform>` configs to the project's [config.xml](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/edge/config_ref_images.md.html#Icons%20and%20Splash%20Screens) file.  During the build process, Cordova (v3.6 or later) will look through the project's [config.xml](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/edge/config_ref_images.md.html#Icons%20and%20Splash%20Screens) file and copy the newly created resource images to the platform's specific resource folder. For example, Android's resource folder can be found in `platforms/android/res`, and iOS uses `platforms/ios/APP_NAME/Resources`.  "
4237,370,https://github.com/dxas90/ionic-cli,### Icon Source Image,3,dxas90.ionic-cli.md,3," Save an `icon.png`, `icon.psd` or `icon.ai` file within the `resources` directory at the root of the Cordova project. The icon image's minimum dimensions should be 192x192 px, and should have __no__ rounded corners. Note that each platform will apply it's own mask and effects to the icons. For example, iOS will automatically apply it's custom rounded corners, so the source file should not already come with rounded corners. This [Photoshop icon template](http://code.ionicframework.com/resources/icon.psd) provides the recommended size and guidelines of the artwork's safe zone.  ```bash $ ionic resources --icon ```  - [Photoshop Icon Template](http://code.ionicframework.com/resources/icon.psd)  "
4238,370,https://github.com/dxas90/ionic-cli,### Splash Screen Source Image,3,dxas90.ionic-cli.md,3," Save a `splash.png`, `splash.psd` or `splash.ai` file within the `resources` directory at the root of the Cordova project. Splash screen dimensions vary for each platform, device and orientation, so a square source image is required the generate each of various sizes. The source image's minimum dimensions should be 2208x2208 px, and its artwork should be centered within the square, knowning that each generated image will be center cropped into landscape and portait images. The splash screen's artwork should roughly fit within a center square (1200x1200 px). This [Photoshop splash screen template](http://code.ionicframework.com/resources/splash.psd) provides the recommended size and guidelines of the artwork's safe zone. Additionally, when the `Orientation` [preference config](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/edge/config_ref_index.md.html#The%20config.xml%20File_global_preferences) is set to either `landscape` or `portrait` mode, then only the necessary images will be generated.  ```bash $ ionic resources --splash ```  - [Photoshop Splash Screen Template](http://code.ionicframework.com/resources/splash.psd)  "
4239,370,https://github.com/dxas90/ionic-cli,### Generating Icons and Splash Screens,3,dxas90.ionic-cli.md,3," To generate both icons and splash screens, follow the instructions above and run:  ```bash $ ionic resources ``` "
4240,370,https://github.com/dxas90/ionic-cli,### Platform Specific Resource Images,3,dxas90.ionic-cli.md,3," One source image can be used to generate images for each platform by placing the file within the `resources` directory, such as `resources/icon.png`. To use different source images for individual platforms, place the source image in the respective platform's directory. For example, to use a different icon for Android, it should follow this path: `resources/android/icon.png`, and a different image for iOS would use this path: `resources/ios/icon.png`. "
4241,370,https://github.com/dxas90/ionic-cli,### Generating Exact Platform Resources,3,dxas90.ionic-cli.md,3," By default the `ionic resources` command will automatically figure out which platforms it should generate according to what platforms have been added to your project. However, you can also explicitly state which resources should be built by providing a platform name in the command. The example below would generate only `ios` resources (even if the platform hasn't been added to the project).  ```bash $ ionic resources ios ``` "
4242,370,https://github.com/dxas90/ionic-cli,### Default Ionic Resources,3,dxas90.ionic-cli.md,3," Ionic provides you some default icons and splash screens to give you a better idea of how to size your icons and splashscreen, as well as how to modify your config.xml file for your own icons.  ```bash $ ionic resources --default ```  If you already have a resources directory, the command above will not over write your files. If you wish to force an over write, use `ionic resources --default --force`.  When starting a new app and adding a platform `ionic platform add ios` - the default icons and splashscreens will be downloaded and your config.xml will be modified to set up the default resources. This should help you identify your Ionic apps easier as well as help you get the file structure and configuration correct.  "
4243,370,https://github.com/dxas90/ionic-cli,## Crosswalk for Android,3,dxas90.ionic-cli.md,2, To install [Crosswalk](https://crosswalk-project.org/) for Android run:  ```bash ionic plugin add cordova-plugin-crosswalk-webview --save ```  All that is left is to run the project as normal - `ionic run android`. 
4244,370,https://github.com/dxas90/ionic-cli,## Advanced serve options,3,dxas90.ionic-cli.md,2," __LiveReload__  By default, for Ionic 1 projects, LiveReload will watch for changes in your `www/` directory, excluding `www/lib/`.  To change this, you can specify a `watchPatterns` property in the `ionic.config.json` file located in your project root to watch (or not watch) for specific changes.  ```json {   ""name"": ""myApp"",   ""app_id"": """",   ""watchPatterns"": [     ""www/js/*"",     ""!www/css/**/*""   ] } ```  For a reference on glob pattern syntax, check out [globbing patterns](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks#globbing-patterns) on the Grunt website.  __Gulp Integration__  When running `ionic serve`, you can have Ionic run any Gulp tasks you specify by putting them into a gulp task called `serve:before`:  ```js gulp.task('serve:before', ['sass', 'watch']); ```  Now, when you run `ionic serve`, it will run the `watch` task while starting the Ionic server.  If you would like to disable gulp from running during serve, pass the `--nogulp` option.  Your gulpfile must be named gulpfile.js or Gulpfile.js, there is currently no support for typescript, babel or coffeescript gulp files in the 2.0 CLI  NOTE For V1:  ```bash $ ionic setup sass ```  will add a `watchPatterns` propery with the default values to your `ionic.config.json` file that you can then edit, in addition to the `serve:before` gulp task described in the [Using Sass](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli/blob/master/README.md#using-sass) section.   __Service Proxies:__  The `serve` command can add some proxies to the http server. These proxies are useful if you are developing in the browser and you need to make calls to an external API. With this feature you can proxy request to the external api through the ionic http server preventing the `No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource` error.  In the `ionic.config.json` file you can add a property with an array of proxies you want to add. The proxies are object with the following properties:  * `path`: string that will be matched against the beginning of the incoming request URL. * `proxyUrl`: a string with the url of where the proxied request should go. * `proxyNoAgent`: (optional) true/false, if true opts out of connection pooling, see [HttpAgent](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent)  ```json {   ""name"": ""appname"",   ""email"": """",   ""app_id"": """",   ""proxies"": [     {       ""path"": ""/v1"",       ""proxyUrl"": ""https://api.instagram.com/v1""     }   ] }  ```  Using the above configuration, you can now make requests to your local server at `http://localhost:8100/v1` to have it proxy out requests to `https://api.instagram.com/v1`  For example:  ```js angular.module('starter.controllers', []) .constant('InstagramApiUrl', '') // .contant('InstagramApiUrl','https://api.instagram.com') //In production, make this the real URL  .controller('FeedCtrl', function($scope, $http, InstagramApiUrl) {    $scope.feed = null;    $http.get(InstagramApiUrl + '/v1/media/search?client_id=1&lat=48&lng=2.294351').then(function(data) {     console.log('data ' , data)     $scope.feed = data;   })  }) ```  See also [this gist](https://gist.github.com/jbavari/d9c1c94058c4fdd4e935) for more help.  __Command-line flags/options:__      [--consolelogs|-c] ......

4245,370,https://github.com/dxas90/ionic-cli,## Using Ionic Labs,3,dxas90.ionic-cli.md,2," We've extended the serve command to open the new Lab UI that features iOS, Android, and Windows side-by-side.  ```bash $ ionic serve --lab ```  If you've used the serve command before, you'll feel right at home with this one. Just like serve, it opens your app in a browser, but now it shows you what your app will look like on a phone, with both iOS, Android, Windows side by side.  And of course, it supports Live Reload and all the other goodies we've added over the last couple of months.  NOTE: This does **not** emulate cordova or cordova plugins. So while the UI may feel like a native app, you'll still want to deploy to a device to test plugins. "
4246,370,https://github.com/dxas90/ionic-cli,## Serving an alternate document root,3,dxas90.ionic-cli.md,2," If you'd like to test your app in the browser and you use a folder other than the default of `www`, you can specify this folder in your `ionic.config.json` file.  You might also want to have the document root be created if you use some sort of build system, we suggest using `createDocumentRoot` for that so that `ionic serve` will create that folder for you.  It is also advised you specify the watch patterns for this document root as well, as follows:  ```json {   ""name"": ""SmoothRiders"",   ""documentRoot"": ""app"",   ""createDocumentRoot"": ""app"",   ""watchPatterns"": [     ""app/js/*"",     ""!app/css/**/*""   ] }  ``` "
4247,370,https://github.com/dxas90/ionic-cli,## Packaging an app (beta),3,dxas90.ionic-cli.md,2," Using Ionic's service, you can compile and package your project into an app-store ready app without requiring native SDKs on your machine.  ```bash $ ionic package debug android ```  The third argument can be either `debug` or `release`, and the last argument can be either `android` or `ios`.  "
4248,370,https://github.com/dxas90/ionic-cli,## Cordova Commands,3,dxas90.ionic-cli.md,2," Ionic uses Cordova underneath, so you can also substitute Cordova commands to prepare/build/emulate/run, or to add additional plugins.  *Note: we occasionally send anonymous usage statistics to the Ionic team to make the tool better.* "
4249,370,https://github.com/dxas90/ionic-cli,## Working around proxies,3,dxas90.ionic-cli.md,2," If you have a proxy you need to get around, you can pass that proxy with the default `http_proxy` [node environment variable](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/misc/npm-config.html#proxy) or an environment variable `proxy`.  A few ways to set up and use the environment variable:  ```bash export http_proxy=internal.proxy.com"
4250,370,https://github.com/dxas90/ionic-cli,# Or,-,dxas90.ionic-cli.md,1,export PROXY=internal.proxy.com  ionic start my_app 
4251,370,https://github.com/dxas90/ionic-cli,"# Additionally, pass in line",-,dxas90.ionic-cli.md,1,PROXY=internal.proxy.com ionic start my_app ```  
4252,370,https://github.com/dxas90/ionic-cli,## Using Sass (V1 Only),3,dxas90.ionic-cli.md,2," By default, V1 starter projects are hooked up to Ionic's precompiled CSS file, which is found in the project's `www/lib/ionic/css` directory, and is linked to the app in the head of the root `index.html` file. However, projects can also be customized using [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), which gives developers and designers ""superpowers"" in terms of creating and maintaining CSS. Below are two ways to setup Sass for your Ionic project (the `ionic setup sass` command simply does the manual steps for you). Once Sass has been setup for your Ionic project, then the `ionic serve` command will also watch for Sass changes.  For V2 projects, there's nothing you need to do! Ionic 2 projects by default are setup with sass and come with all the build process enabled. "
4253,370,https://github.com/dxas90/ionic-cli,#### Setup Sass Automatically (V1),3,dxas90.ionic-cli.md,4,     ionic setup sass  
4254,370,https://github.com/dxas90/ionic-cli,#### Setup Sass Manually (V1),3,dxas90.ionic-cli.md,4," 1. Run `npm install` from the working directory of an Ionic project. This will install [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/) and a few handy tasks, such as [gulp-sass](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-sass) and [gulp-minify-css](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-minify-css). 2. Remove `<link href=""lib/ionic/css/ionic.css"" rel=""stylesheet"">` from the `<head>` of the root `index.html` file. 3.

4287,373,https://github.com/jacknjzhou/raet,# RAET (Reliable Asynchronous Event Transport) Protocol,1,jacknjzhou.raet.md,1,
4288,373,https://github.com/jacknjzhou/raet,## Motivation,12,jacknjzhou.raet.md,2," Modern large scale distributed application architectures, wherein components are distributed across the internet on multiple hosts and multiple CPU cores, are often based on a messaging or event bus that allows the various distributed components to communicate asynchronously with each other. Typically the messaging bus is some form of messaging queue service such as AMQP or ZeroMQ. The message bus supports what is commonly referred to as a publish/subscribe methodology for information exchange.  While there are many advantages to a full featured message queuing service, one of the disadvantagesis the inability to manage performance at scale.  A message queuing service performs two distinct but complementary functions.  - The first is asynchronous transport of messages over the internet. - The second is message queue management, that is, the identification, tracking, storage, and distribution of messages between publishers and subscribers via queues.  One of the advantages of a message queuing service for many applications is that the service hides behind an API, the complexities of queue management from the clients. The disadvantage is that at scale, where the volume of messages, the timing of messages, and the associated demands on memory, network, and cpu capacity become critical, the client has little ability to tune the service for performance. Often MQ services become bottlenecks for the distributed application. The more complicated MQ services, like AMQP, tend to be unreliable under load.  Separating the function of network transport of asynchrounous event from the function of message queue management allows independant tuning at scale of each function.  Most if not all of the MQ services are based on TCP/IP for transport. TCP/IP adds significant latency to the network communications and is therefore not well suited for the asynchronous nature of distibuted event driven application communications. This is primarily due to the way TCP/IP handles connection setup and teardown as well as failed connections in order to support streams. Fundamentally TCP/IP is optomized for sending large contiguous data streams not many small aynchronous events or messages. While not a problem for small scale systems, the differences in the associated traffic characteristics can become problematic at scale.  Because UDP/IP has lower latency and is connectionless, it is much better suited to many small asynchronous messages and scales better. The drawback of bare UDP/IP is that it is not reliable. What is needed, therefore, is a tuned transport protocol that adds reliability to UDP/IP without sacrificing latency and scalability. A transactioned protocol, is much more appropriate for providing reliablity to asynchronous event transport than a streaming protocol.  Morover, because most MQ services are based on TCP/IP they tend to also use HTTP and therefore TLS/SSL for secure communications. While using HTTP provides easy integration with web based systems, it can become problematic for high performant systems Furthermore, TLS is also problematic as a security system both from performance and vulnerabilty aspects.  Elliptic Curve Cryptography, on the other hand, provides increases in security with lower performance requirements relative to over other approaches. LibSodium provides an open source Elliptic Curve Cryptographic library with support for both authentication and encryption. The CurveCP protocol is based on LibSodium and provides a handshake protocol for bootstrapping secure network exchanges of information.  Finally, one of the best ways to manage and fine tune processor resources (cpu, memory, network) in distributed concurrent event driven applications is to use something called micro-threads. A microthread is typically an in-language feature that allows logical concurrency with no more overhead than a function call. Micro threading uses cooperative multi-tasking instead of threads and/or processes and avoids many of the complexities of resource contention, context switching, and interprocess communications while providing much higher total performance.  Because all the cooperative micro-threads run in one process, a simple micro-threaded application is limited to one CPU core. To enable full utilization of all CPU cores, the application needs to be able to run at least one process per CPU core. This requires same host inter-process communications. But unlike the conventional approach to multi-processing  where there is of one process per logical concurrent function, a micro-threaded multi-process application has instead one micro-thread per logical concurrent function and the total number of micro-threads is distributed amoungst a minimal number of processes, no more than the number of cpu cores. This optimizes the use of the cpu power while minimizes the overhead of process context switching.  An example of a framework that uses this type of micro-threaded but multi-process architecture is Erlang. Indeed, the success of the Erlang model provided support for the viability of the RAET approach. Indeed, one might ask, why not use Erlang? Unfortunately, the Erlang ecosystem is somewhat limited in comparison to Python's and the language itself uses what one might describe as a very unfortunate syntax. One of the design objectives behine RAET was to leverage existing Python expertise and the richness of the Python ecosystem but still be able to develop distributed applications using a micro-threaded multi-process architectural model. The goal was to combine the best of both worlds.  RAET is designed to provide secure reliable scalable asynchronous message/event transport over the internet in a micro-threaded multi-process application framework that uses UDP for interhost communication and LibSodium for authentication, encryption and the CurveCP handshake for secure bootstrap.  The queue management and micro-threaded application support is provided by Ioflo. RAET is a complementary project to Ioflo in that RAET enables multiple Ioflo applications to work together over a network as part of a distributed application.  The primary use case and motivating problem that resulted in the development of RAET was the need to enable SaltStack to scale better. SaltStack is a remote execution and configuration management platform written in Python. SaltStack uses ZeroMQ (0MQ) as its message bus or message queuing service. ZeroMQ is based on TCP/IP so suffers from the aforementioned latency and non-asynchronicity issues of TCP/IP based architectures. Moreover because ZeroMQ integrates queue management and transport in a monolithic way with special ""sockets"", tuning the performance of the queuing independent of the transport at scale becomes problematic. Tracing down bugs can also be problematic.  "

This is a UXD channel. - The members of a Lane are “Yards”  (as in subdivision plots within the Estate) - Each Yard on a Lane has a unique UXD file name host address “ha’, and a unique string “name”.     There is also a numerical Yard ID “yid"" that the class uses to generate yard     names but it is not an attribute of the Yard instance. - The Lane name is also used with the Yard Name to form a unique Filename that     is the ha of the UXD - One Yard on a Lane is  the “Main” Yard - The Main Yard is responsible for forming the Lane and permitting other Yards     to be on the lane. There is yet no formal process for this.     Currently there is a flag that will drop packets from any Yard that is not     already in the list of Yards maintained by the Main yard.     Also file permissions can be used to prevent spurious Yards from communicating     with the Main Yard. - The Main Yard is responsible for routing messages between other yards on the Lane  "
4294,373,https://github.com/jacknjzhou/raet,## IoFlo Execution,3,jacknjzhou.raet.md,2," - Each Estate UDP interface is run via a RoadStack (UDP sockets)     which is run within the context of an IoFlo House     (so think of the House that runs the UDP Stack as the Manor House of the Estate) - Each Yard UXD interface is run via a LaneStack (Unix domain socket)     which is run within the context of an IoFlo House     (so think of Houses that run UXD stacks as accessory Houses (Tents, Shacks) on the Estate) - The ""Manor"" House is special in that it runs both the UDP stack for the Estate      and also runs the UXD Stack for the Main Yard - The House that runs the Main Estate UDP Stack can be thought of as Mayor’s House - Within the context of a House is a Data Store. Shares in the Store are Addressed     by the unique Share Name which is a dotted path "
4295,373,https://github.com/jacknjzhou/raet,## Routing,3,jacknjzhou.raet.md,2," Given the Ioflo execution architecture described above, routing is performed as follows:  - In order to address a specific Estate, the Estate Name is required - In order to address a specific Yard within an Estate, the Yard Name is required - In order to address a specific Queue within a House, the Share Name is required  The UDP stack maps Estate Name to UDP HA and Estate ID The UXD stack maps Yard Name to UXD HA The Store of any IoFlo behavior maps Share Name to Share reference  Therefore Routing from: a source identified by     a queue in a source Share,     in a source Yard,     in a source Estate to: a destination identified by     a queue, in a destination Share,     in a destination Yard,     in a destination Estate  requires two Triples, one for Source and one for Destination  Source (Estate Name, Yard Name, Share Name)  Destination (Estate Name, Yard Name, Share Name)  If any element of the Triple is None or Empty then a Default is used.  Below is an example of a Message Body that has the Routing information it it.   ```python     estate = 'minion1'     stack0 = stacking.StackUxd(name='lord', lanename='cherry', yid=0)     stack1 = stacking.StackUxd(name='serf', lanename='cherry', yid=1)     yard = yarding.Yard( name=stack0.yard.name, prefix='cherry')     stack1.addRemoteYard(yard)      src = (estate, stack1.yard.name, None)     dst = (estate, stack0.yard.name, None)     route = odict(src=src, dst=dst)     msg = odict(route=route, stuff=""Serf to my lord.

Once the protocol reaches a more mature state and its not likely that there will be any header changes (or very infrequent) then a binary format that minimizes size will be provided.  When the head kind is json = 0, then certain optimizations are used to minimize the header length. - The header field keys are two bytes long - If a header field value is the default then the field is not included - Lengths are encoded as hex strings - The flags are encoded as a double char hex string in field 'fg'  "

4304,373,https://github.com/jacknjzhou/raet,### Packet Parts,3,jacknjzhou.raet.md,3, Each packet has 4 parts some of which may be empty. These are: - Head - Body - Coat - Tail  The Head is manditory and provides the header fields that are needed to process the packet.  The Tail provides the authentication signature that is used to verify the source of the packet and that its contents have not been tampered with.  The Body is the contents of the packet. Some packets such as Acks and Nacks don't need a body. The Body is a serialized Python dictionary typically and ordered dictionary so that parsing and debugging has a consistent view of the ordering of the fields in the body.  The Coat is the encrypted version of the body. The encryption type is CurveCP based. If the Coat is provided then the Body is encapsulated within the Coat Part.

These means the header must be ascii safe  so no multibyte utf-8 strings are allowed in the header. "
4307,373,https://github.com/jacknjzhou/raet,#### Native Encoding,3,jacknjzhou.raet.md,4," The header consists of newline delimited lines. Each header line consists of a two character field identifier followed by a space followed by the value of the field as ascii hex encoded binary followed by newline.

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are nothing new to you, in fact you even know a few tricks to get this feature out the door. It doesn&#8217;t take you long and the code works like a charm, yet you have a looming suspicion that some of the code might not be up to par. You&#8217;re likely right, and you&#8217;re definitely better than that.  We often write code without paying attention to the bigger picture, or overall code base. Upon stepping back we notice areas of duplicate code, ripe for refactoring. It&#8217;s time to build more modular front ends, focusing on the reusability of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and to take maintainability to heart. "

4373,377,https://github.com/TLINDEN/novel-mode,# Demo,3,TLINDEN.novel-mode.md,1, ![demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TLINDEN/novel-mode/master/demo.gif) 
4374,377,https://github.com/TLINDEN/novel-mode,# Introduction,1,TLINDEN.novel-mode.md,1," Novel  mode is  a minor  mode which  converts emacs  into a  screen reader, or in other words,  it enables distraction free reading. It is however not  suited for distraction free  editing. Try writeroom mode if you're looking for this.  When turned on, it does the following conversions:    - disable almost all distractions, as menu, toolbar, scrollbar   - enlarge font size   - switch to variable width font   - enable word wrap (without fringe marker)   - increase line spacing   - add a window margin to the left and right (thereby centering the text)   - disable all input keys (rendering the buffer read-only)   - disable the cursor   - switch to buffer-scrolling (like e.g. in Acroread)   - display current reading position in percent   - add a couple of convenience one-key commands  Novel mode provides the following one-key commands, when active:      n           scroll one page down     p           scroll one page up     <down>      scroll one line down     <up>        scroll one line up     mousewheel  scroll linewise up or down     SPC         scroll one page down     <left>      increase margins, makes visible text narrower     <right>     decrease margins, makes visible text wider     +           increase font size     -           decrease font size     i           invert video display     q           quit novel mode     ?           display key mapping  Important: while normal  key input (beside the  ones listed above), is disabled, Control and Meta still work, of course. Please be also aware that this mode might conflict with god-mode or evil-mode.  If you use this  mode quite often, then it might be  a good idea to use save-place mode,  so that a text file will  be opened where you left last time (just like any  ebook reader would do). Here's how to do that:      (if (version< emacs-version ""25.0"")         (progn           (require 'saveplace)           (setq-default save-place t))       (save-place-mode 1))   The name  novel mode is  not my idea,  there's a function  on Xah's ergomacs   page  with   a  function   for  this   kind  of   stuff: http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_novel_reading_mode.html.  In fact, this mode is based on this function, I had it in my .emacs file and enhanced it  all the  time.  At  some point it  made more  sence to maintain this baby in its own mode - hence novel-mode. "
4375,377,https://github.com/TLINDEN/novel-mode,# Install,3,TLINDEN.novel-mode.md,1," To use, save novel-mode.el to a directory in your load-path.  Add something like this to your config:      (require 'novel-mode)     (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'novel-mode)  or load it manually, when needed:      M-x novel-mode "
4376,377,https://github.com/TLINDEN/novel-mode,# Customize,3,TLINDEN.novel-mode.md,1," You can customize the following variables:  To setup a default left and right margin, use this:      (setq novel-default-margin 50)  All available  novel-mode variables  can be  modified interactively with:       M-x customize-group RET novel-mode RET  You can also use hooks to novel  mode as a way to modify or enhance its behavior.  The following hooks are available:      novel-mode-pre-start-hook     novel-mode-post-start-hook     novel-mode-pre-stop-hook     novel-mode-post-stop-hook  Example:      (add-hook 'novel-mode-post-start-hook               (lambda ()                 (set-face-font 'default ""DejaVu Sans"")))     (add-hook 'novel-mode-post-stop-hook               (lambda ()                 (set-face-font 'default ""Courier""))) "

4392,379,https://github.com/tdeborge/angular-phonecat,### step-0 _Bootstrapping_,3,tdeborge.angular-phonecat.md,3, - Add the 'angular.js' script. - Add the `ngApp` directive to bootstrap the application. - Add a simple template with an expression. 
4393,379,https://github.com/tdeborge/angular-phonecat,### step-1 _Static Template_,3,tdeborge.angular-phonecat.md,3, - Add a stylesheet file ('app/app.css'). - Add a static list with two phones. 
4394,379,https://github.com/tdeborge/angular-phonecat,### step-2 _Angular Templates_,3,tdeborge.angular-phonecat.md,3, - Convert the static phone list to dynamic by:   - Creating a `PhoneListController` controller.   - Extracting the data from HTML into the controller as an in-memory dataset.   - Converting the static document into a template with the use of the `ngRepeat` directive. - Add a simple unit test for the `PhoneListController` controller to show how to write tests and   run them using Karma. 
4395,379,https://github.com/tdeborge/angular-phonecat,### step-3 _Components_,3,tdeborge.angular-phonecat.md,3," - Introduce components. - Combine the controller and the template into a reusable, isolated `phoneList` component. - Refactor the application and tests to use the `phoneList` component. "
4396,379,https://github.com/tdeborge/angular-phonecat,### step-4 _Directory and File Organization_,3,tdeborge.angular-phonecat.md,3," - Refactor the layout of files and directories, applying best practices and techniques that will   make the application easier to maintain and expand in the future:   - Put each entity in its own file.   - Organize code by feature area (instead of by function).   - Split code into modules that other modules can depend on.   - Use external templates in `.html` files (instead of inline HTML strings). "
4397,379,https://github.com/tdeborge/angular-phonecat,### step-5 _Filtering Repeaters_,3,tdeborge.angular-phonecat.md,3, - Add a search box to demonstrate:   - How the data-binding works on input fields.   - How to use the `filter` filter.   - How `ngRepeat` automatically shrinks and grows the number of phones in the view. - Add an end-to-end test to:   - Show how end-to-end tests are written and used.   - Prove that the search box and the repeater are correctly wired together. 
4398,379,https://github.com/tdeborge/angular-phonecat,### step-6 _Two-way Data Binding_,3,tdeborge.angular-phonecat.md,3, - Add an `age` property to the phone model. - Add a drop-down menu to control the phone list order. - Override the default order value in controller. - Add unit and end-to-end tests for this feature. 
4399,379,https://github.com/tdeborge/angular-phonecat,### step-7 _XHR & Dependency Injection_,3,tdeborge.angular-phonecat.md,3, - Replace the in-memory dataset with data loaded from the server (in the form of a static   'phone.json' file to keep the tutorial backend agnostic):   - The JSON data is loaded using the `$http` service. - Demonstrate the use of `services` and `dependency injection` (DI):   - `$http` is injected into the controller through DI.   - Introduce DI annotation methods: `.$inject` and inline array 
4400,379,https://github.com/tdeborge/angular-phonecat,### step-8 _Templating Links & Images_,3,tdeborge.angular-phonecat.md,3, - Add a phone image and links to phone pages. - Add an end-to-end test that verifies the phone links. - Tweak the CSS to style the page just a notch. 
4401,379,https://github.com/tdeborge/angular-phonecat,### step-9 _Routing & Multiple Views_,3,tdeborge.angular-phonecat.md,3," - Introduce the `$route` service, which allows binding URLs to views for routing and deep-linking:   - Add the `ngRoute` module as a dependency.   - Configure routes for the application.   - Use the `ngView` directive in 'index.html'. - Create a phone list route (`/phones`):   - Map `/phones` to the existing `phoneList` component. - Create a phone detail route (`/phones/:phoneId`):   - Map `/phones/:phoneId` to a new `phoneDetail` component.   - Create a dummy `phoneDetail` component, which displays the selected phone ID.   - Pass the `phoneId` parameter to the component's controller via `$routeParams`. "

4408,379,https://github.com/tdeborge/angular-phonecat,### Installing Dependencies,3,tdeborge.angular-phonecat.md,3," The application relies upon various Node.js tools, such as [Bower][bower], [Karma][karma] and [Protractor][protractor]. You can install these by running:  ``` npm install ```  This will also run Bower, which will download the Angular files needed for the current step of the tutorial.  Most of the scripts described below will run this automatically but it doesn't do any harm to run it whenever you like. "
4409,379,https://github.com/tdeborge/angular-phonecat,### Running the Application during Development,3,tdeborge.angular-phonecat.md,3, - Run `npm start`. - Navigate your browser to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) to see the application - running. 
4410,379,https://github.com/tdeborge/angular-phonecat,### Unit Testing,3,tdeborge.angular-phonecat.md,3," We recommend using [Jasmine][jasmine] and [Karma][karma] for your unit tests/specs, but you are free to use whatever works for you.  - Start Karma with `npm test`. - A browser will start and connect to the Karma server. Chrome and Firefox are the default browsers,   others can be captured by loading the same URL or by changing the `karma.conf.js` file. - Karma will sit and watch your application and test JavaScript files. To run or re-run tests just   change any of your these files. "
4411,379,https://github.com/tdeborge/angular-phonecat,### End-to-End Testing,3,tdeborge.angular-phonecat.md,3," We recommend using [Protractor][protractor] for end-to-end (e2e) testing.  It requires a webserver that serves the application. See the _Running the Application during Development_ section, above.  - Serve the application with: `npm start` - In a separate terminal/command line window run the e2e tests: `npm run protractor`. - Protractor will execute the e2e test scripts against the web application itself. The project is   set up to run the tests on Chrome directly. If you want to run against other browsers, you must   modify the configuration at `e2e-tests/protractor-conf.js`.  "

4420,381,https://github.com/jaredkirkley/formBuilder,## What is formBuilder?,13,jaredkirkley.formBuilder.md,2,"FormBuilder is a library that can be used to create forms online. These forms will be able to accept user input and save the data in varying ways depending on what data-types have been chosen for the input fields.  There are many different input field data-types and each have different filters, validation methods, and options that dictate what kind of data they can or can not accept, and how the input fields will look and behave. These types have been developed to meet the typical needs of what would be desired from an online form, such as a phone number type, an email type, a regular text input type, and many more. If you would like to see a full list of the input types that are available to you with formBuilder please feel free to look ahead to the <a href=""./guide.html#dataTypes"">Data Types</a> section in the User Guide.  It is also possible, if these types do not meet the requirements of what is needed for a form that is being built, to easily design a custom input type by modifying a set of base methods, or developing a regular expression to define what input will be allowed in the new type. A more detailed description of how to do this can be found in the <a href=""./guide.html#customization"">Customization</a> section of the User Guide.  If you would like to see an example of a form that is built using formBuilder, and how the data from that form is saved, feel free to look ahead to our <a href=""./guide.html#demo"">Live Demo</a>. "
4421,381,https://github.com/jaredkirkley/formBuilder,## How is formBuilder used?,16,jaredkirkley.formBuilder.md,2,"FormBuilder is used by creating forms and then initializing them as formBuilder widgets. FormBuilder will construct the form fields automatically. You can then build upon those forms by adding as many different kinds of input as are desired.  If you would like to know how to use formBuilder and see examples of each different input types and how they work, please feel free to look ahead to the <a href=""./guide.html#basics"">User Guide</a>.  For a more in-depth understanding of how to use and manipulate each different available resource in the formBuilder library, please feel free to look ahead to our <a href='./api.html#widgets'>[API Reference]()</a> "
4422,381,https://github.com/jaredkirkley/formBuilder,## Why should I use formBuilder?,2,jaredkirkley.formBuilder.md,2,"FormBuilder allows you to create complicated input fields on forms by using only one or two lines of code in your html file. By implementing one or two attributes on an input field you will be able to apply large changes to how the field will appear and how it will handle data.  It is also a quick and easy way to be able to eliminate most human error from any online form that you are trying to build. By using input types that have been designed to only accept certain entries you can help to prevent the chance that forms will be submitted to you incorrectly.  FormBuilder is also very easy to understand and implement into your code. The user guide and API reference that have been provided to you are useful tools to be able to understand and see examples of how to build your form using formBuilder. In short, formBuilder is a useful tool that can be used to enhance any online form that you are trying to build.   "

Here's how you use `you-get` to download a video from [this web page](http://www.fsf.org/blogs/rms/20140407-geneva-tedx-talk-free-software-free-society):  ```console $ you-get http://www.fsf.org/blogs/rms/20140407-geneva-tedx-talk-free-software-free-society Site:       fsf.org Title:      TEDxGE2014_Stallman05_LQ Type:       WebM video (video/webm) Size:       27.12 MiB (28435804 Bytes)  Downloading TEDxGE2014_Stallman05_LQ.webm ... 100.0% ( 27.1/27.1 MB) ├████████████████████████████████████████┤[1/1]   12 MB/s ```  And here's why you might want to use it:  * You enjoyed something on the Internet, and just want to download them for your own pleasure. * You watch your favorite videos online from your computer, but you are prohibited from saving them. You feel that you have no control over your own computer. (And it's not how an open Web is supposed to work.) * You want to get rid of any closed-source technology or proprietary JavaScript code, and disallow things like Flash running on your computer. * You are an adherent of hacker culture and free software.  What `you-get` can do for you:  * Download videos / audios from popular websites such as YouTube, Youku, Niconico, and a bunch more. (See the [full list of supported sites](#supported-sites)) * Stream an online video in your media player. No web browser, no more ads. * Download images (of interest) by scraping a web page. * Download arbitrary non-HTML contents, i.e., binary files.  Interested?

If that looks cool to you, download it:  ``` $ you-get 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw' site:                YouTube title:               Me at the zoo stream:     - itag:          43       container:     webm       quality:       medium       size:          0.5 MiB (564215 bytes)     # download-with: you-get --itag=43 [URL]  Downloading zoo.webm ... 100.0% (  0.5/0.5  MB) ├████████████████████████████████████████┤[1/1]    7 MB/s  Saving Me at the zoo.en.srt ...Done. ```  (If a YouTube video has any closed captions, they will be downloaded together with the video file, in SubRip subtitle format.)  Or, if you prefer another format (mp4), just use whatever the option `you-get` shows to you:  ``` $ you-get --itag=18 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw' ```  **Note:**  * At this point, format selection has not been generally implemented for most of our supported sites; in that case, the default format to download is the one with the highest quality. * `ffmpeg` is a required dependency, for downloading and joining videos streamed in multiple parts (e.g. on some sites like Youku), and for YouTube videos of 1080p or high resolution. * If you don't want `you-get` to join video parts after downloading them, use the `--no-merge`/`-n` option. "
4469,385,https://github.com/hobmgcode/you-get,### Download anything else,3,hobmgcode.you-get.md,3," If you already have the URL of the exact resource you want, you can download it directly with:  ``` $ you-get https://stallman.org/rms.jpg Site:       stallman.org Title:      rms Type:       JPEG Image (image/jpeg) Size:       0.06 MiB (66482 Bytes)  Downloading rms.jpg ... 100.0% (  0.1/0.1  MB) ├████████████████████████████████████████┤[1/1]  127 kB/s ```  Otherwise, `you-get` will scrape the web page and try to figure out if there's anything interesting to you:  ``` $ you-get http://kopasas.tumblr.com/post/69361932517 Site:       Tumblr.com Title:      kopasas Type:       Unknown type (None) Size:       0.51 MiB (536583 Bytes)  Site:       Tumblr.com Title:      tumblr_mxhg13jx4n1sftq6do1_1280 Type:       Portable Network Graphics (image/png) Size:       0.51 MiB (536583 Bytes)  Downloading tumblr_mxhg13jx4n1sftq6do1_1280.png ... 100.0% (  0.5/0.5  MB) ├████████████████████████████████████████┤[1/1]   22 MB/s ```  **Note:**  * This feature is an experimental one and far from perfect. It works best on scraping large-sized images from popular websites like Tumblr and Blogger, but there is really no universal pattern that can apply to any site on the Internet. "
4470,385,https://github.com/hobmgcode/you-get,### Search on Google Videos and download,3,hobmgcode.you-get.md,3," You can pass literally anything to `you-get`. If it isn't a valid URL, `you-get` will do a Google search and download the most relevant video for you. (It might not be exactly the thing you wish to see, but still very likely.)  ``` $ you-get ""Richard Stallman eats"" ``` "
4471,385,https://github.com/hobmgcode/you-get,### Pause and resume a download,3,hobmgcode.you-get.md,3," You may use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to interrupt a download.  A temporary `.download` file is kept in the output directory. Next time you run `you-get` with the same arguments, the download progress will resume from the last session. In case the file is completely downloaded (the temporary `.download` extension is gone), `you-get` will just skip the download.  To enforce re-downloading, use the `--force`/`-f` option. (**Warning:** doing so will overwrite any existing file or temporary file with the same name!) "
4472,385,https://github.com/hobmgcode/you-get,### Set the path and name of downloaded file,3,hobmgcode.you-get.md,3," Use the `--output-dir`/`-o` option to set the path, and `--output-filename`/`-O` to set the name of the downloaded file:  ``` $ you-get -o ~/Videos -O zoo.webm 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw' ```  **Tips:**  * These options are helpful if you encounter problems with the default video titles, which may contain special characters that do not play well with your current shell / operating system / filesystem. * These options are also helpful if you write a script to batch download files and put them into designated folders with designated names. "
4473,385,https://github.com/hobmgcode/you-get,### Proxy settings,3,hobmgcode.you-get.md,3," You may specify an HTTP proxy for `you-get` to use, via the `--http-proxy`/`-x` option:  ``` $ you-get -x 127.0.0.1:8087 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw' ```  However, the system proxy setting (i.e. the environment variable `http_proxy`) is applied by default. To disable any proxy, use the `--no-proxy` option.  **Tips:**  * If you need to use proxies a lot (in case your network is blocking certain sites), you might want to use `you-get` with [proxychains](https://github.com/rofl0r/proxychains-ng) and set `alias you-get=""proxychains -q you-get""` (in Bash). * For some websites (e.g. Youku), if you need access to some videos that are only available in mainland China, there is an option of using a specific proxy to extract video information from the site: `--extractor-proxy`/`-y`. "
4474,385,https://github.com/hobmgcode/you-get,### Watch a video,3,hobmgcode.you-get.md,3," Use the `--player`/`-p` option to feed the video into your media player of choice, e.g. `mplayer` or `vlc`, instead of downloading it:  ``` $ you-get -p vlc 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw' ```  Or, if you prefer to watch the video in a browser, just without ads or comment section:  ``` $ you-get -p chromium 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw' ```  **Tips:**  * It is possible to use the `-p` option to start another download manager, e.g., `you-get -p uget-gtk 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw'`, though they may not play together very well. "
4475,385,https://github.com/hobmgcode/you-get,### Load cookies,3,hobmgcode.you-get.md,3," Not all videos are publicly available to anyone. If you need to log in your account to access something (e.g., a private video), it would be unavoidable to feed the browser cookies to `you-get` via the `--cookies`/`-c` option.  **Note:**  * As of now, we are supporting two formats of browser cookies: Mozilla `cookies.sqlite` and Netscape `cookies.txt`. "
4476,385,https://github.com/hobmgcode/you-get,### Reuse extracted data,3,hobmgcode.you-get.md,3," Use `--url`/`-u` to get a list of downloadable resource URLs extracted from the page.

4493,388,https://github.com/mraimi/insight2,##Implementation details,1,mraimi.insight2.md,2,"Submission by Michael Raimi (raimi.michael@gmail.com)    I decided to represent the graph as an adjacency list keyed by username which I assumed to be unique. This assumption was supported by the numerical suffixes on names such as 'Caroline-Kaiser-2'. The value of the adjacency list is a tuple of the node's degree count and a set of neighbors the node shares an edge with. It's a set to prevent any bookkeeping issues in the event of records with the same target/actor pair.  The 60 second window is represented by a list (used essentially as a queue) of tuples of target, actor, datetime records. It is always in order by timestamp and has linear insertion on out of order nodes but is O(1) otherwise.  NOTE: In the event that multiple records in the same 60 second window have the same target/actor pair multiple records in the window are created with unique datetimes but no new edges are created, and as a result no degree counts are modified. This has the same effect as updating the edge's timestamp.  Below are other data structures and counts used to support graph operations and modifications:  - There is a dictionary keeping track of how many instances of a certain degree exist in the graph e.g. there are 6 nodes with degree 3.  - There is a list of integers that represents the current degree values in the graph e.g. there are nodes of degree 3, 6, 7, and so on. It's always sorted.  - There is a total node count used for sanity checking and to lookup the median  - There is a dictionary keeping count of how many times a unique target/actor pair is received. The size of this data structure is linear in the number of edges and vertices of the graph multiplied by some factor d, which represents the highest number of records made by a single target/actor pair. In Big-O it would be O(d(V + E)). This implementation would be prohibitive in the case where a few power users make tons of transactions. An alternative implementation to this would be to remove the old record from the window and insert the new one in the correct position. This would have linear processing cost in the size of records in the window but could reduce the memory footprint by a constant factor. This implementation would be somewhat prohibitive in the case of a window with many records all fitting within the 60 second constraint as an insertion "
4494,388,https://github.com/mraimi/insight2,##Calculating the median,1,mraimi.insight2.md,2,"If we imagine all the possible degree values in a sorted list we could use the size of the list to find the value(s) in the middle representing the median degree. This code uses a similar approach by using the total node count, sorted degree keys, and the degree count dictionary to find the median. In short we iterate through the keys, using each one to key into the dictionary to find the degree where the median lies. It runs in time linear in the size of the degree key list which in the big dataset of 1800 was of size < 20.  Thanks for taking the time to consider me for the fellowship!     "

4497,389,https://github.com/johnsonyang/compass,##工程结构,-,johnsonyang.compass.md,2,Compass分为4个子模块：    * compass-core： Compass框架最核心的功能模块，提供指定路由键(RouteKey)的情况下的分布式数据库访问。    * compass-delayfree：提供主从反延迟的策略的集成，如果不使用该功能可以不依赖。    * compass-aggregation：提供有限程度的全库扫描、多库聚合和排序支持，如果不使用聚合功能可以不依赖。    * compass-sample:提供配置和代码编写范例。

4501,389,https://github.com/johnsonyang/compass,####动态数据源,-,johnsonyang.compass.md,4,对JDBC规范的DataSource、Connection、Statement等接口进行代理，分为单库数据源SingleDataSource、主从数据源MasterSlaveDataSource和分库数据源ShardDataSource这3种数据源，其中MasterSlaveDataSource包含一个或多个SingleDataSource，ShardDataSource包含一个或多个MasterSlaveDataSource，MasterSlaveDataSource根据数据源切换预处理器设置的信息实现主从库选择、故障探测和HA等功能。ShardDataSource则根据据数据源切换预处理器设置的信息实现分库和分表路由、Sql解析和表名替换等功能。  
4502,389,https://github.com/johnsonyang/compass,##框架工作流程,-,johnsonyang.compass.md,2,"Compass框架工作流程如下图所示：  ![flow](https://github.com/sogou-biztech/compass/blob/master/flow.jpg ""flow"")  1. 上层应用(比如Action层)对Service层的调用会被数据源切换预处理器所拦截，数据源切换预处理器收集分库路由键，主从库读写策略(决定本次访问应该读取主库还是从库)、Service方法名、主从库反延时键保存在threadLocal里面的RouteContext对象中，供后续步骤使用。  2. Service层调用Dao层的方法执行数据库操作的时候，会通过Spring JdbcTemplate、MyBatis和Hibernate等数据访问层框架访问到分库数据源ShardDataSource。  3. ShardDataSource根据保存在threadLocal中的RouteContext里面的分区路由键和用户配置的路由策略进行路由，定位出当前的操作应该路由到哪个主从数据源MasterSlaveDataSource的哪个分表上，路由结果的唯一标识在代码中用TableContext表示。注意如果是在分库之后再进一步进行了分表的话，需要同时对这次操作涉及的SQL语句进行解析，根据路由结果标识TableContext将SQL语句中的逻辑表名替换为实际的物理分表的表名，拿用户账号表acount举例，如果用户输入的SQL语句为select * from account，并且路由结果为这个SQL语句应该路由到1号库的第8张分表，那么改写之后的SQL语句就形如select * from account_01_08。  4. ShardDataSource路由到某个MasterSlaveDataSource之后,MasterSlaveDataSource会进一步根据保存在threadLocal中的RouteContext里面的用户配置的主从库读写策略和主从库反延时策略来进行主从选择。如果选择读取从库，那么需要进一步根据用户配置的负载均衡策略在多个从库之间进行负载均衡，同时如果有从库出现故障还需要及时探测到并进行HA，MasterSlaveDataSource最终会选择出一个单库数据源SingleDataSource来进行操作。  5. SingleDataSource只是对实际的连接池数据源(比如DBCP、C3P0等)的简单封装，SingleDataSource会将操作都委托给连接池数据源进行实际的数据库访问。  "
4503,389,https://github.com/johnsonyang/compass,##SQL语法支持,-,johnsonyang.compass.md,2,对于分库分表的时候需要对SQL语句中的数据表名进行修改的情况，Compass采用开源项目[JSqlParser](https://github.com/JSQLParser/JSqlParser)进行SQL解析并进行表名修改，目前采用的JSqlParser版本是0.9.4。  
4504,389,https://github.com/johnsonyang/compass,##JDK版本支持,-,johnsonyang.compass.md,2,Compass支持JDK1.6以及以上的版本。

However, we've included the sources and you can build your own `clang++` from scratch as follows.  Ensure you have the `base-devel` group installed and the `multilib` repository enabled. Afterwards you can build the package in the standard Arch Linux fashion:      cd ~/abs     makepkg -s  After building the tool, you can use our set of 16 small test cases you run to ensure the tool works correctly. Navigate to the test directory to see these tests:      cd ~/abs/src/llvm-csan-0.0.1/projects/compiler-rt/test/csan  Note: if you haven't built the tool, this directory will not exist, do the following first:      cd ~/abs     makepkg -o  The expected test results are embedded within the source files themselves. Any lines with `CHECK` are expected to occur on `stderr` when the source file is compiled and run with our tool enabled. Any lines beginning with `CHECK-NOT` should not occur when our tool is used. To run all the tests do the following:      cd ~/abs/src/llvm-csan-0.0.1/build     make check-csan  Note 1: you must have built the tool in order to run `make check-csan`!  Note 2: for the timing results in the paper, ran a debug version of the tool. To build a debug version, follow these steps:      cd ~/abs     makepkg -s -p PKGBUILD-debug  Then replace the current version of our packages with these debugging ones with:      pacman -U *.pkg.tar.xz "

You do need to `cd ~/abs; makepkg -o` as described above, though.  To manually run them yourself do the following:      cd ~     clang++ -fsanitize=const -g ~/abs/src/llvm-csan-0.0.1/projects/compiler-rt/test/csan/const-object.cc -o const-object     ./const-object  You may explore all the other tests by exploring `~/abs/src/llvm-csan-0.0.1/projects/compiler-rt/test/csan` and running them in a similar manner.

4597,396,https://github.com/eyolfson/research-2016-ecoop-artifact,## Usage,3,eyolfson.research-2016-ecoop-artifact.md,2," To use the tool, use `clang++` as you normally would, but add the flags `-fsanitize=const -g`. You should get more precise results if you disable optimizations and include the frame pointer with `-O0 -fno-omit-frame-pointer`. To run the example given in Listing 1 of the paper, do the following:      cd ~/examples     clang++ -std=c++11 -fsanitize=const -g listing-1.cpp  You can run the resulting executable as `./a.out` and you should see a warning. To write to an external log file, use the `log_path` option. For example, to log the results to a file called `listing-1.log` do the following:      CSAN_OPTIONS=log_path=listing-1.log ./a.out  After running the program again, there should be no extra output on `stderr` and there should be a `listing-1.log.XXXXX` file in the current directory where `XXXXX` are random numbers.

To extract the sources, do the following:      cd ~/abs     makepkg -o  The first part of the implementation is getting Clang to annotate definition expressions of declaration statements so that ConstSanitizer can ignore them. The code implementing this is in: `~/abs/src/llvm-csan-0.0.1/tools/clang/lib/CodeGen/CGDebugInfo.cpp` and `~/abs/src/llvm-csan-0.0.1/tools/clang/lib/CodeGen/CGDebugInfo.h`. The part of the code generation we instrument is in `~/abs/src/llvm-csan-0.0.1/tools/clang/lib/CodeGen/CGDecl.cpp` within the `EmitAutoVarDecl` method.  The heart of our implementation is located at: `~/abs/src/llvm-csan-0.0.1/lib/Transforms/Instrumentation/ConstSanitizer.cpp`. This file corresponds to the instrumentation of LLVM bit code that implements our runtime const tracking. The computation of the shadow values is in the `getShadowVal` method.  The runtime library is located at: `~/abs/src/llvm-csan-0.0.1/projects/compiler-rt/lib/csan/csan.cc`. This file contains the implementation that reports the stack traces at runtime.  The modification to get Clang to recongize our new sanitizer option is located at: `~/abs/src/llvm-csan-0.0.1/tools/clang/lib/CodeGen/BackendUtil.cpp`. "
4599,396,https://github.com/eyolfson/research-2016-ecoop-artifact,## Experiments,3,eyolfson.research-2016-ecoop-artifact.md,2," All experiments are located in the `experiments` directory. To instrument a project, for example Ninja, do the following:      cd ~/experiments     python build.py ninja  The build script stores any build-time violations (for instance, that occur while running a project's tests as part of the build) in the `experiments` directory, in a file named `PACKAGE-build.log`. Ninja is an example of a project that runs tests as part of its build.  To create groupings for manual inspection, run `python group.py ninja`. The `group.py` script collects all results from log files with the specified project name.  The next subsections give examples of how we obtained the results in the paper. "

So you may do the following:      cd ~/experiments     python build.py protobuf     python group.py protobuf-build  These results should be comparable to `~/results/protobuf.txt` after organization. Note that running the tests produces many `protobuf-build.log.XXXXX` files. While the `group.py` script does combine all build log files, the resulting file still contains a separate section for each build log file. We manually combined these sections and report combined results from all build logs.  Note that before manual post-processing we found 216 unique warnings with 169736 occurences. There was one archetype, relating to message targets, we could not determine and did not include in the paper. This archetype had 133 unique warnings with 14638 occurences and were manually identified. We also had a false positive due to incorrect debugging information (we believe). This archetype had 7 unique locations with 27454 occurences. Manually removing these results should exactly match the results in the paper. "

Therefore the `ninja-build.log.XXXXX` shows what violations occur as part of the test suite. If you open this file and observe it, the first non-standard library portion of the stack trace should be in `src/disk_interface_test.cc:226:3` matching the results of the paper. There should be 4 unique source locations, starting in the standard library, for all violations. To find these unique source locations, like for all other experiments, use the group script:      cd ~/experiments     python group.py ninja-build  This will group the raw results into unique locations and also give the dynamic violation count.

To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:      ./mvnw package -Pprod docker:build  Then run:      docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d  For more information refer to [Using Docker and Docker-Compose][], this page also contains information on the docker-compose sub-generator (`jhipster docker-compose`), which is able to generate docker configurations for one or several JHipster applications.

And you will realize that the code produced by such tools as Selenium IDE and Selenium Builder is good in the beginning…  However, the test suites created with Record & Playback tools will require so much maintenance time, so you would put more effort on fixing the tests rather than running them. That is the hidden cost of the Record & Playback approach.  At this point, you will discover many teams uses PageObjects in order to reduce the maintenance time and boosts the test case creation.

It does this by transforming your Java 8 compiled bytecode so that it can run on an older Java runtime. After the transformation they are just a bunch of normal .class files, without any additional runtime dependencies. [Read more details](#backported-language-features).  There is also [limited support](#known-limitations) for backporting **default methods** and **static methods on interfaces**. This feature is disabled by default.  Retrolambda supports backporting to Java 7, Java 6 and Java 5 runtimes. And for adventurous developers there are [other backporting tools](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_backporting_tools) that may let you go from Java 5 down to Java 1.4.  Android developers may use Retrolambda to take advantage of the Java 8 features on Android. Serge Zaitsev has written [an article about it](http://zserge.com/blog/android-lambda.html) and there is a [Gradle plugin](#gradle-plugin) which makes it easy.  Retrolambda does not backport the new Java 8 APIs, but there are other projects that have backported some of them:  * [streamsupport](http://sourceforge.net/projects/streamsupport/) backports the `java.util.stream` API * [ThreeTen](http://www.threeten.org/) backports the `java.time` API  "

4644,401,https://github.com/cushon/retrolambda,### Tips,3,cushon.retrolambda.md,3," Be sure to run comprehensive tests on your target JVM version (e.g. Java 7), in case the code accidentally uses Java 8 APIs or language features that Retrolambda doesn't backport.  During development, inside an IDE, it's the easiest to use Java 8, without Retrolamba, to compile and run tests. But in your continuous integration and release builds you should run all tests using the target Java version. For example, you can configure Maven Surefire Plugin to run tests [using a different JVM](http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/test-mojo.html#jvm).  I recommend setting up environment variables JAVA8_HOME, JAVA7_HOME etc. and referring to those variables in the build configuration, instead of relying on what happens to be the default Java version in JAVA_HOME.  You will need Java 8 for compiling and also for generating Javadocs. JDK 7's Javadoc tool will fail for some valid Java 8 code.  "
4645,401,https://github.com/cushon/retrolambda,## Backported Language Features,1,cushon.retrolambda.md,2,"----------------------------  **Lambda expressions** are backported by converting them to anonymous inner classes. This includes the optimization of using a singleton instance for stateless lambda expressions to avoid repeated object allocation.  **Method references** are basically just syntax sugar for lambda expressions and they are backported in the same way.  **Try-with-resources statements** are backported by removing calls to `Throwable.addSuppressed` if the target bytecode version is below Java 7. If you would like the suppressed exceptions to be logged instead of swallowed, please create a feature request and we'll make it configurable.  *Optionally also:*  **Default methods** are backported by copying the default methods to a companion class (interface name + ""$"") as static methods, replacing the default methods in the interface with abstract methods, and by adding the necessary method implementations to all classes which implement that interface.  **Static methods on interfaces** are backported by moving the static methods to a companion class (interface name + ""$""), and by changing all methods calls to call the new method location.<sup>[1]</sup>  <sup>[1]</sup> *The static methods are moved to a companion class even with default method support disabled, because some of them may be lambda implementation methods, but the method calls to static methods are not updated. This may cause weird error messages if static methods on interfaces are accidentally used without enabling default method support.*  "
4646,401,https://github.com/cushon/retrolambda,## Known Limitations,3,cushon.retrolambda.md,2,"-----------------  Does not backport Java 8 APIs.  Backporting default methods and static methods on interfaces requires all backported interfaces and all classes which implement them or call their static methods to be backported together, with one execution of Retrolambda. In other words, you must *always do a clean build*. Also, backporting default methods won't work across module or dependency boundaries.  May break if a future JDK 8 build stops generating a new class for each `invokedynamic` call. Retrolambda works so that it captures the bytecode that `java.lang.invoke.LambdaMetafactory` generates dynamically, so optimizations to that mechanism may break Retrolambda.  "

4728,409,https://github.com/mbrannigan/salt-state-test,## Why this exists,2,mbrannigan.salt-state-test.md,2," As with any programming language, there is a good chance that when editing a salt state, you have made a mistake.  In order to detect these mistakes, the salt engine needs to read your state, and apply it with the grains and pillars appropriate for the minion you are targeting.  Salt makes it very easy to test with an active master (or similar situations such as a masterless setup, or salt-ssh) by putting the state on the master (or similar) and calling the test_state, e.g.:  ``` root@saltmaster# salt test-minion state.show_sls test_state ```  This will display the state when it renders.  However, the cost of this is longer than what's ideal.  In order to provide a slightly faster unit testing cycle, as well as a pre-commit hook that can be used to prevent unintended errors from getting into git, this script can do much of the same compilation as a salt master and the state.show\_sls state (this uses the show\_sls state). "
4729,409,https://github.com/mbrannigan/salt-state-test,## How I'm thinking about this,1,mbrannigan.salt-state-test.md,2," The primary differences are as follows:  1. All configuration is contained within the script and its configuration. 1. Grain data is not discovered from minions, it's provided in configuration. 1. Pillar data is provided as a json file rather than data collected by the saltmaster.  For each state that is being tested, a pseudo-run is initiated.  It gathers its data from the grain configuration, pillar configuration, and internal values (most of which are default values internal to salt).  Once that data is obtained, the pseudo-run is executed and the state.show\_sls function is used to return the data structure that is the result of the state being rendered.  To test a hypothesis, it's important to have an hypothesis in the first place.  The results of the pseudo-run are compared with the desired results.  Any differences present in the relevent keys cause the run in general to fail (this is to support acting as a git hook, so that a broken state isn't committed).  When the test script is invoked without any flags, only keys that exist in the desired result are compared to the actual result.  This makes it easy to get started, because you can start with no expectations and add expecetations as you go along.  However, the ""-t"" flag can be passed to the script in order to ""test all"" "

So, if you're testing the state called state1.init, it's defined in the file state1/init.sls.  When the test is run, it will apply the grains from the top-level test/grains.json, and the pillar values that are provided in the state1/test/pillar.json file, and those are provided to the state1.init state and compare the output the data in the json document state1/test/init.json.  The test will fail if there are differences between the keys that will be tested, and the output.

The raw KDevelop comes with extremely useful cross-reference and code parsing tools, but they do not apply well to the Linux kernel.

Without them lots of functions and data structures will appear as undeclared. - A lot of the code (power management, SMP, etc) is conditionally compiled depending on the kernel configuration which is translated into more C defines.

Just typing `cmake . && make && sudo make install` should be enough to have the project installed. Then in KDevelop, do ""Project -> Open/Import Project..."" and select the root Makefile of your Linux kernel. When prompted for the type of the project, choose ""Linux Kernel"".  Then open the project's configuration and in the ""Linux Kernel"" pane select your kernel configuration file. You will then need to restart KDevelop so the right kernel files are parsed with the right defines. "

We do our best to verify every signature that appears on the website. It requires a great deal of human effort to verify thousands of signatures, so we stopped accepting new signatures for manual verification at noon PST Dec 21, after accepting signatures for 8 days. We are still processing a large backlog of submitted signatures, so the number of signatures on the website will continue to increase, but we are no longer accepting new signatures.  Even though we are no longer accepting new signatures to show on the website, you can still sign the pledge in many ways. Remember, the pledge is a personal, individual commitment; announcing your commitment is an invitation to others to help you hold yourself accountable. Here are some ways to do that:   * Tweet ""I, &lt;*your name*&gt;, hereby commit to the neveragain.tech pledge. Please stand with me and hold me to it. #neveragaintech""   * Post ""I, &lt;*your name*&gt;, hereby commit to the neveragain.tech pledge.

If it's not, you need to [shim it](https://github.com/thlorenz/browserify-shim#a-expose-global-variables-via-global): ```javascript {   ""browserify-shim"": {     ""jquery"": ""global:jQuery""   } } ``` "
4762,414,https://github.com/ghamry/jquery.hotkeys,## Notes,3,ghamry.jquery.hotkeys.md,2, Modifiers are not case sensitive (`Ctrl` == `ctrl` == `cTRL`)  If you want to use more than one modifier (e.g. `alt+ctrl+z`) you should define them by an alphabetical order e.g. alt+ctrl+shift  Hotkeys aren't tracked if you're inside of an input element (unless you explicitly bind the hotkey directly to the input). This helps to avoid conflict with normal user typing.  You can use namespacing by adding a suffix to the event type (e.g. `keyup.toggle`)  
4763,414,https://github.com/ghamry/jquery.hotkeys,## Hotkeys within inputs,3,ghamry.jquery.hotkeys.md,2," Hotkeys aren't tracked if the user is focused within an input element or any element that has `contenteditable=""true""` unless you bind the hotkey directly to the element. This helps to avoid conflict with normal user typing. If you don't want this, you can change the booleans of the following to suit:   * `jQuery.hotkeys.options.filterInputAcceptingElements`  * `jQuery.hotkeys.options.filterContentEditable`  * `jQuery.hotkeys.options.filterTextInputs` (deprecated, will be removed in a later version) "

4769,414,https://github.com/ghamry/jquery.hotkeys,### Addendum,3,ghamry.jquery.hotkeys.md,3," Firefox is the most liberal one in the manner of letting you capture all short-cuts even those that are built-in in the browser such as `Ctrl-t` for new tab, or `Ctrl-a` for selecting all text. You can always bubble them up to the browser by returning `true` in your handler.  Others, (IE) either let you handle built-in short-cuts, but will add their functionality after your code has executed. Or (Opera/Safari) will *not* pass those events to the DOM at all.  *So, if you bind `Ctrl-Q` or `Alt-F4` and your Safari/Opera window is closed don't be surprised.*"

Easy, right? Not, exactly.  1. We have integer counts and not continous measurements. Data is not normally distributed, so statistical methods we applied to microarray data don't work here.  2. Replication levels in designed RNA-Seq experiments tend to be modest, often not much more than two or three. As a result, there is a need for statistical methods that perform well in small-sample situations.  3. There is a dependence of variance on the mean (which changes with increasing number of replicates)  **Solution:** Appropriate modelling of the mean-variance relationship in DGE data is important for making inferences about differential expression. Employing methods which assess the mean-variance relationship to help with the problem of estimating biological variability for experiments with small number of replicates.  In this module, learners will use [R Statistical Software](https://www.r-project.org/) to walk-through activities designed to compare the performance of different tools (edgeR, DESeq2, limma-voom) for differential expression analysis of RNA-Seq data, and how the mean-variance relationship is addressed in datasets with increasing number of replicates.    > ## Learning Objectives > > * understanding the relationship between mean and variance and how that changes with the number of replicates > * familiarizing yourself with tools for DE analysis in R > * understanding the importance of having replicates in a RNA-Seq study "

The aim should be to create a professional, slick feel.  - **Version controlled using git** - You must use git to track your project, and it must be submitted to the Github repository I have created in a folder called your Github username. _You must make at least 15 git commits! There is a prize for whoever makes the most commits._  Help each other, google around, and use this as an opportunity to get comfortable with the concepts we have learnt this week.

4796,420,https://github.com/javillegas/unity3d-store,## Getting Started,3,javillegas.unity3d-store.md,2," 1. Download the [soomla-unity3d-core](http://library.soom.la/fetch/unity3d-core/1.0.4?cf=github) and [unity3d-store](http://library.soom.la/fetch/unity3d-store/1.7.9?cf=github) unitypackages and double-click on them (first 'Core' then 'Store'). It'll import all the necessary files into your project. 2. Drag the ""StoreEvents"" and ""CoreEvents"" Prefabs from `../Assets/Soomla/Prefabs` into your scene. You should see it listed in the ""Hierarchy"" panel. [This step MUST be done for unity3d-store to work properly] 3. On the menu bar click ""Window -> Soomla -> Edit Settings"" and change the value for ""Soomla Secret"" (also setup Public Key if you're building for Google Play):     - _Soomla Secret_ - is an encryption secret you provide that will be used to secure your data. (If you used versions before v1.5.2 this secret MUST be the same as Custom Secret)     **Choose the secret wisely. You can't change them after you launch your game!**     - _Public Key_ - is the public key given to you from Google. (iOS doesn't have a public key). 4. Create your own implementation of _IStoreAssets_ in order to describe your specific game's assets ([example](https://github.com/soomla/unity3d-store/blob/master/Soomla/Assets/Examples/MuffinRush/MuffinRushAssets.cs)). Initialize _SoomlaStore_ with the class you just created:      ```cs     SoomlaStore.Initialize(new YourStoreAssetsImplementation());     ```      > Initialize _SoomlaStore_ ONLY ONCE when your application loads.      > Initialize _SoomlaStore_ in the ""Start()"" function of a 'MonoBehaviour' and **NOT** in the ""Awake()"" function. SOOMLA has its own 'MonoBehaviour' and it needs to be ""Awakened"" before you initialize.  5. You'll need an event handler in order to be notified about in-app purchasing related events. refer to the [Event Handling](https://github.com/soomla/unity3d-store#event-handling) section for more information.  And that's it ! You have storage and in-app purchasing capabilities... ALL-IN-ONE. "
4797,420,https://github.com/javillegas/unity3d-store,### Unity & Android,3,javillegas.unity3d-store.md,3,
4798,420,https://github.com/javillegas/unity3d-store,#### Starting IAB Service in background,3,javillegas.unity3d-store.md,4," If you have your own storefront implemented inside your game, it's recommended that you open the IAB Service in the background when the store opens and close it when the store is closed.  ```cs // Start Iab Service SoomlaStore.StartIabServiceInBg();  // Stop Iab Service SoomlaStore.StopIabServiceInBg(); ```  Don't forget to close the Iab Service when your store is closed. You don't have to do this at all, this is just an optimization.  "
4799,420,https://github.com/javillegas/unity3d-store,## What's next? In App Purchasing.,3,javillegas.unity3d-store.md,2," When we implemented modelV3, we were thinking about ways that people buy things inside apps. We figured out many ways you can let your users purchase stuff in your game and we designed the new modelV3 to support 2 of them: PurchaseWithMarket and PurchaseWithVirtualItem.  **PurchaseWithMarket** is a PurchaseType that allows users to purchase a VirtualItem with Google Play or the App Store. **PurchaseWithVirtualItem** is a PurchaseType that lets your users purchase a VirtualItem with a different VirtualItem. For Example: Buying 1 Sword with 100 Gems.  In order to define the way your various virtual items (Goods, Coins ...) are purchased, you'll need to create your implementation of IStoreAsset (the same one from step 4 in the ""Getting Started"" above).  Here is an example:  Lets say you have a _VirtualCurrencyPack_ you call `TEN_COINS_PACK` and a _VirtualCurrency_ you call `COIN_CURRENCY`:  ```cs VirtualCurrencyPack TEN_COINS_PACK = new VirtualCurrencyPack( 	            ""10 Coins"",                    // name 	            ""A pack of 10 coins"",      // description 	            ""10_coins"",                    // item id 				10,								// number of currencies in the pack 	            COIN_CURRENCY_ITEM_ID,         // the currency associated with this pack 	            new PurchaseWithMarket(""com.soomla.ten_coin_pack"", 1.99) 		); ```  Now you can use _StoreInventory_ to buy your new VirtualCurrencyPack:  ```cs StoreInventory.buyItem(TEN_COINS_PACK.ItemId); ```  And that's it! unity3d-store knows how to contact Google Play or the App Store for you and will redirect your users to their purchasing system to complete the transaction. Don't forget to subscribe to store events in order to get the notified of successful or failed purchases (see [Event Handling](https://github.com/soomla/unity3d-store#event-handling)).  "
4800,420,https://github.com/javillegas/unity3d-store,## Storage & Meta-Data,3,javillegas.unity3d-store.md,2,"---  When you initialize _SoomlaStore_, it automatically initializes two other classes: _StoreInventory_ and _StoreInfo_: * _StoreInventory_ is a convenience class to let you perform operations on VirtualCurrencies and VirtualGoods. Use it to fetch/change the balances of VirtualItems in your game (using their ItemIds!) * _StoreInfo_ is where all meta data information about your specific game can be retrieved. It is initialized with your implementation of `IStoreAssets` and you can use it to retrieve information about your specific game.  The on-device storage is encrypted and kept in a SQLite database. SOOMLA is preparing a cloud-based storage service that will allow this SQLite to be synced to a cloud-based repository that you'll define.  **Example Usages**  * Get VirtualCurrency with itemId ""currency_coin"":      ```cs     VirtualCurrency coin = (VirtualCurrency) StoreInfo.GetItemByItemId(""currency_coin"");     ```  * Give the user 10 pieces of a virtual currency with itemId ""currency_coin"":      ```cs     StoreInventory.GiveItem(""currency_coin"", 10);     ```  * Take 10 virtual goods with itemId ""green_hat"":      ```cs     StoreInventory.TakeItem(""green_hat"", 10);     ```  * Get the current balance of green hats (virtual goods with itemId ""green_hat""):      ```cs     int greenHatsBalance = StoreInventory.GetItemBalance(""green_hat"");     ``` "
4801,420,https://github.com/javillegas/unity3d-store,## Event Handling,3,javillegas.unity3d-store.md,2,"---  SOOMLA lets you subscribe to store events, get notified and implement your own application specific behavior to those events.  > Your behavior is an addition to the default behavior implemented by SOOMLA. You don't replace SOOMLA's behavior.  The 'Events' class is where all event go through. To handle various events, just add your specific behavior to the delegates in the Events class.  For example, if you want to 'listen' to a MarketPurchase event:  ``` cs StoreEvents.OnMarketPurchase += onMarketPurchase;  public void onMarketPurchase(PurchasableVirtualItem pvi, string payload, Dictionary<string, string> extra) {     // pvi is the PurchasableVirtualItem that was just purchased     // payload is a text that you can give when you initiate the purchase operation and you want to receive back upon completion     // extra will contain platform specific information about the market purchase.     //      Android: The ""extra"" dictionary will contain ""orderId"" and ""purchaseToken"".     //      iOS: The ""extra"" dictionary will contain ""receipt"" and ""token"".      // ... your game specific implementation here ... } ```  **NOTE:** One thing you need to notice is that if you want to listen to OnSoomlaStoreInitialized event you have to set up the listener before you initialize SoomlaStore. So you'll need to do: ```` StoreEvents.OnSoomlaStoreInitialized += onSoomlaStoreInitialized; ```` before ```` Soomla.SoomlaStore.Initialize(new Soomla.Example.MuffinRushAssets()); ```` "

4862,429,https://github.com/LordWiley/node-taas-client,### Set!,36,LordWiley.node-taas-client.md,3," You can identify the steward by either:  - steward.name:     - IP address, e.g., '192.168.1.xxx', or '127.0.0.1'     - domain name, e.g., 'zekariah', or 'localhost'     - place name, i.e., place1.name such as 'zephyr'  - steward.uuid:     - place UUID, e.g., 2f402f80-da50-11e1-9b23-0123456789ab  The place and the UUID are advertised by the steward on the local network. You should also include a reference to either the location of the steward's certificate file (steward.crtPath) or the actual certificate itself (steward.crtData).  If your steward is registered with a TAAS cloud, then you should also deifne the cloud.service domain and the location of TAAS certificate (cloud.crtPath) or the actual certificate itself (cloud.CrtData).  The state machine is fairly simple:  - There are two channels: 'console' and 'management'.  - Each of these channels will emit an 'open' event, letting you know whether login is required.  - When a channel is ready for use, it will emit a 'ready' event     - In the case of the 'console' channel, the 'data' parameter is an array indicating what privileges are authorized.      - In the case of the 'management' channel, the 'data' parameter is a user object.  - If either channel detects a remote close or an error, then these events are emitted, respectively.  The API does not attempt to recover on either a close, or error. Instead, you may choose to start over or exit, as you see fit.       var steward = new ClientAPI.ClientAPI(     { steward : { name    : 'steward.local'                 , crtPath : 'server.crt'                 }      , cloud   : { service : 'taas.thethingsystem.net'                 , crtPath : 'cloud.crt'                 }     }).on('open', function(channel, loginP) {       // check to see if login required       if (!loginP) {         if (channel === 'management') console.log('steward in developer mode, no need to log in.');         return;       }        steward.login('mrose/7', '889791', function(err, error) {         if (!!err) return console.log('>>> login error: ' + JSON.stringify(error));          // logged in!       });     }).on('ready', function(channel, data) {       // when the management channel is ready, it's time to get to work!       if (channel !== 'management') return;        // ok, let's get to work!     }).on('close', function(channel) {       // typically, just log and recover/exit     }).on('error', function(err, channel) {       // typically, just log and recover/exit     }); "
4863,429,https://github.com/LordWiley/node-taas-client,### Go!,36,LordWiley.node-taas-client.md,3," There is one state variable, 'actors', that is an object containing information about all known actors in the system, e.g., 'place/1', 'device/1', and so on. As changes are reported by the steward, an 'actor' event is omitted with the identity and classification of the actor:      // use this event to filter changes on either a particular device (whoami) or deviceType (whatami)     steward.on('actor', function(whoami, whatami) {      });  The API provides several methods to communicate with the steward. Each method takes a callback which may be invoked more than once. Blocking operations in the steward typically result in two callbacks, the first is a success or failure indicator; and, if success is indicated, then a subsequent callback is made. The 'list*' and 'perform*' operations are not blocking, hence the callback is made exactly once.      // if (!doneP), then only a success/failure indication is present, and a subsequent invocation will occur!     var cb = function(message, doneP) { ... };      // invoked exactly once     var cb1 = function(message) { ... };       steward.createActivity(name, uuid, event, task, armed, comments, cb);      steward.createDevice(name, uuid, whatami, info, comments, cb);      steward.createEvent(name, uuid, actor, observe, parameter, comments, cb);      steward.createGroup(name, uuid, type, operator, members, comments, cb);      steward.createTask(name, uuid, actor, perform, parameter, comments, cb);      steward.createUser(name, uuid, role, clientName, comments, cb);       steward.listActivity(activityID, options, cb1);      steward.listActors(prefix, options, cb1);      steward.listDevice(deviceID, options, cb1);      steward.listEvent(eventID, options, cb1);      steward.listGroup(groupID, options, cb1);      steward.listTask(taskID, options, cb1);      steward.listUser(userID, options, cb1);       steward.modifyActivity(activityID, name, armed, event, task, cb);      steward.modifyGroup(groupID, name, type, operator, members, cb);       steward.performActivity(activityID, cb1);      steward.performActor = function(prefix, perform, parameter, cb1);      steward.performDevice(deviceID, perform, parameter, cb1);      steward.performGroup(groupID, perform, parameter, cb1);      steward.performTask(taskID, cb1);       steward.deleteActivity = function(activityID, cb);      // steward.deleteDevice = function(deviceID, cb);      steward.deleteEvent = function(eventID, cb);      steward.deleteGroup = function(groupID, cb);      steward.deleteTask = function(taskID, cb);  "

Yamp is the simple library for constructing text parsers directly in JavaScript code.  Yamp can be used to parse low to medium complex DSL.  -----  Yamp parser is the combination of other parsers - primitive (like parser for a single char) or more complex.  A simplest parser that parse just a single character:  	//Parse a single char 'a' 	var charParser = yamp.Char('a'); 	var result = yamp.Parse(charParser, 'a');  More complex parsers can be created with parser combiners functions:  	//Parse a stream of chars that can contains 0 to unlimited chars 'a' 	var charStreamParser = yamp.Many(yamp.Char('a')); 	var result = yamp.Parse(charStreamParser, 'aaaaa');  Yamp has fluent API to help configuring parsers:  	//Parsers can be configured with method chaining 	var charStreamParser = yamp.Char('a').Many(); 	var result = charStreamParser.Parse('aaaaa');  Unlike traditional parsers (ANTLR, yacc) yamp doesn`t have separate stages for lexical and syntax parse. If input string can contains comments, you need to remove them before calling yamp parser - or include comments support into parser (than can really challenging task depending on DLS complexity). "

4912,435,https://github.com/bdurand/whenever,### Define your own job types,3,bdurand.whenever.md,3," Whenever ships with three pre-defined job types: command, runner, and rake. You can define your own with `job_type`.  For example:  ```ruby job_type :awesome, '/usr/local/bin/awesome :task :fun_level'  every 2.hours do   awesome ""party"", :fun_level => ""extreme"" end ```  Would run `/usr/local/bin/awesome party extreme` every two hours. `:task` is always replaced with the first argument, and any additional `:whatevers` are replaced with the options passed in or by variables that have been defined with `set`.  The default job types that ship with Whenever are defined like so:  ```ruby job_type :command, "":task :output"" job_type :rake,    ""cd :path && :environment_variable=:environment bundle exec rake :task --silent :output"" job_type :runner,  ""cd :path && bin/rails runner -e :environment ':task' :output"" job_type :script,  ""cd :path && :environment_variable=:environment bundle exec script/:task :output"" ```  Pre-Rails 3 apps and apps that don't use Bundler will redefine the `rake` and `runner` jobs respectively to function correctly.  If a `:path` is not set it will default to the directory in which `whenever` was executed. `:environment_variable` will default to 'RAILS_ENV'. `:environment` will default to 'production'. `:output` will be replaced with your output redirection settings which you can read more about here: <http://github.com/javan/whenever/wiki/Output-redirection-aka-logging-your-cron-jobs>  All jobs are by default run with `bash -l -c 'command...'`. Among other things, this allows your cron jobs to play nice with RVM by loading the entire environment instead of cron's somewhat limited environment. Read more: <http://blog.scoutapp.com/articles/2010/09/07/rvm-and-cron-in-production>  You can change this by setting your own `:job_template`.  ```ruby set :job_template, ""bash -l -c ':job'"" ```  Or set the job_template to nil to have your jobs execute normally.  ```ruby set :job_template, nil ``` "
4913,435,https://github.com/bdurand/whenever,### Capistrano integration,3,bdurand.whenever.md,3," Use the built-in Capistrano recipe for easy crontab updates with deploys. For Capistrano V3, see the next section.  In your ""config/deploy.rb"" file:  ```ruby require ""whenever/capistrano"" ```  Take a look at the recipe for options you can set. <https://github.com/javan/whenever/blob/master/lib/whenever/capistrano/v2/recipes.rb> For example, if you're using bundler do this:  ```ruby set :whenever_command, ""bundle exec whenever"" require ""whenever/capistrano"" ```  If you are using different environments (such as staging, production), then you may want to do this:  ```ruby set :whenever_environment, defer { stage } require ""whenever/capistrano"" ```  The capistrano variable `:stage` should be the one holding your environment name. This will make the correct `:environment` available in your `schedule.rb`.  If both your environments are on the same server you'll want to namespace them or they'll overwrite each other when you deploy:  ```ruby set :whenever_environment, defer { stage } set :whenever_identifier, defer { ""#{application}_#{stage}"" } require ""whenever/capistrano"" ``` "
4914,435,https://github.com/bdurand/whenever,### Capistrano V3 Integration,3,bdurand.whenever.md,3," In your ""Capfile"" file:  ```ruby require ""whenever/capistrano"" ```  Take a look at the [load:defaults task](https://github.com/javan/whenever/blob/master/lib/whenever/capistrano/v3/tasks/whenever.rake) (bottom of file) for options you can set. For example, to namespace the crontab entries by application and stage do this in your ""config/deploy.rb"" file:  ```ruby set :whenever_identifier, ->{ ""#{fetch(:application)}_#{fetch(:stage)}"" } ```  The Capistrano integration by default expects the `:application` variable to be set in order to scope jobs in the crontab.  If your deploy user is different than your application user, you can specify to set the crontab user with:  ```ruby set :whenever_user, ""appuser"" ```  "
4915,435,https://github.com/bdurand/whenever,### Capistrano roles,3,bdurand.whenever.md,3," The first thing to know about the new roles support is that it is entirely optional and backwards-compatible. If you don't need different jobs running on different servers in your capistrano deployment, then you can safely stop reading now and everything should just work the same way it always has.  When you define a job in your schedule.rb file, by default it will be deployed to all servers in the whenever_roles list (which defaults to [:db]).  However, if you want to restrict certain jobs to only run on subset of servers, you can add a :roles => [...] argument to their definitions. **Make sure to add that role to the whenever_roles list in your deploy.rb.**  When you run `cap deploy`, jobs with a :roles list specified will only be added to the crontabs on servers with one or more of the roles in that list.  Jobs with no :roles argument will be deployed to all servers in the whenever_roles list. This is to maintain backward compatibility with previous releases of whenever.  So, for example, with the default whenever_roles of [:db], a job like this would be deployed to all servers with the :db role:  ```ruby every :day, :at => '12:20am' do   rake 'foo:bar' end ```  If we set whenever_roles to [:db, :app] in deploy.rb, and have the following jobs in schedule.rb:  ```ruby every :day, :at => '1:37pm', :roles => [:app] do   rake 'app:task' # will only be added to crontabs of :app servers end  every :hour, :roles => [:db] do   rake 'db:task' # will only be added to crontabs of :db servers end  every :day, :at => '12:02am' do   command ""run_this_everywhere"" # will be deployed to :db and :app servers end ```  Here are the basic rules:    1. If a server's role isn't listed in whenever_roles, it will *never* have jobs      added to its crontab.   1. If a server's role is listed in the whenever_roles, then it will have all      jobs added to its crontab that either list that role in their :roles arg or      that don't have a :roles arg.   1. If a job has a :roles arg but that role isn't in the whenever_roles list,      that job *will not* be deployed to any server. "
4916,435,https://github.com/bdurand/whenever,### RVM Integration,3,bdurand.whenever.md,3," If your production environment uses RVM (Ruby Version Manager) you will run into a gotcha that causes your cron jobs to hang.  This is not directly related to Whenever, and can be tricky to debug.  Your .rvmrc files must be trusted or else the cron jobs will hang waiting for the file to be trusted.  A solution is to disable the prompt by adding this line to your user rvm file in `~/.rvmrc`  `rvm_trust_rvmrcs_flag=1`  This tells rvm to trust all rvmrc files. "
4917,435,https://github.com/bdurand/whenever,### Heroku?,6,bdurand.whenever.md,3," No. Heroku does not support cron, instead providing [Heroku Scheduler](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduler). If you deploy to Heroku, you should use that rather than Whenever. "
