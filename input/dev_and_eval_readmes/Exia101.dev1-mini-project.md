# Web Technology Mini-Project
##  Javascript Web Development Course

Your task is to create your own simple one-page portfolio website using the technologies we have learnt so far. It must be: 

 - **Planned and wireframed** - Starting from what content you want on the page, and through a series of wireframes increasing in fidelity.
 - **Built with HTML and CSS** - These are the only required technologies for the project. Javascript or jQuery can only be added _ONCE THE STATIC VERSION IS COMPLETELY FINISHED (*cough* Jay)_.
 - **Compliant with WAI-ARIA standards** - Your site must be fully accessible. Use the WAVE toolbar to check this, don't forget to add ARIA roles.
 - **Semantically correct** - You must use the correct semantic tags for your particular layout.
 - **Responsive** - It must be designed mobile first, and made responsive using carefully selected CSS attributes and media queries.
 - **Visually distinctive** - You should select a colour scheme and layout that you like, simple is best! The aim should be to create a professional, slick feel.
 - **Version controlled using git** - You must use git to track your project, and it must be submitted to the Github repository I have created in a folder called your Github username. _You must make at least 15 git commits! There is a prize for whoever makes the most commits._ 

Help each other, google around, and use this as an opportunity to get comfortable with the concepts we have learnt this week. That's more important than the outcome of the project.

It's due on Tuesday morning at 9.30am! It must be on github by that time.
