What the plugin does for you
============================

jmsPaymentPlugin is designed to provide a generic persistence layer for processing payments. 

* It is not coupled to any specific payment provider, or process flow.
* It does not make assumptions about your domain model.
* It has a flexible event system that allows you to hook into the payment process without altering payment classes.
* It is easy to add new payment methods (support for PayPal, and Micropayment already built-in)
* It is robust, and stable due to many unit tests.
