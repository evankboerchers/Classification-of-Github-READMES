#Project 5: Make Your App Material

In this project, you will redesign an app to follow the Material Design
guidelines and translate a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app.

##Why this Project

This project gives you an opportunity to improve an app’s design, a vital 
skill for building apps users will love. It also replicates a common developer
task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.

##What Will I Learn?

Through this project, you will:

* Understand the fundamentals of Android design.
* Apply Material Design guidelines to an mobile application.
* Separate an interface into surfaces.
* Effectively use transitions and motion.

##How Do I Complete this Project?

You will improve an app for this project:

XYZ Reader: A mock RSS feed reader featuring banner photos and shocking headlines!

Download the code here :

The app is currently functional, and work in most cases for most users.

Your job will be to take the user feedback in the UI Review node, and implement
changes that will improve the UI and make it conform to Material Design.

###Supporting Courses

You should have the skills you need to complete this app after completing:

* Developing Android Apps

* Advanced Android App Development
https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud855
* Material Design for Android Developers

###Required Tasks

* Download a zip file of the app.
* Read the UI Review in the next node.
* Spend time exploring the current state of the app, looking for ways it
could be improved. The app will need multiple improvements. Be sure to look 
specifically at issues called out in the UI Review.
* Execute the improvements!
* Make a single GitHub repo with your code for the app and submit it through 
the Nanodegree portal. See the Submission and Evaluation node for detailed instructions.


##User Feedback for XYZ Reader:

###Lyla says:

“This app is starting to shape up but it feels a bit off in quite a few places.
 I can't put finger on it but it feels odd.”

###Jay says:

“Is the text supposed to be so wonky and unreadable? It is not accessible 
to those of us without perfect vision."

###Kagure says:

“The color scheme is really sad and I shouldn't feel sad.”
