# The Definitive Guide to Elasticsearch 

This repository contains the sources to the "Definitive Guide to Elasticsearch" which you can [read online](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/index.html).
 
## Building the Definitive Guide

In order to build this project, we rely on our [docs infrastructure](https://github.com/elastic/docs).

To build the HTML of the complete project, run the following commands:

```
# clone this repo
git clone git@github.com:elastic/elasticsearch-definitive-guide.git
# clone the docs build infrastructure
git clone git@github.com:elastic/docs.git
# Build HTML and open a browser
cd elasticsearch-definitive-guide
../docs/build_docs.pl --doc book.asciidoc --open
```

This assumes that you have all necessary prerequisites installed. For a more complete reference, please refer to the [README in the docs repo](https://github.com/elastic/docs).

The Definitive Guide is written in Asciidoc and the docs repo also contains a [short Asciidoc guide](https://github.com/elastic/docs#asciidoc-guide).
