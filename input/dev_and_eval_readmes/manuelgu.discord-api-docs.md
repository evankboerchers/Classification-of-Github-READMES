# Discord Official API Documentation

This repo contains the official Discord API documentation, which can be viewed online [HERE](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro). Before submitting pull-requests, please remember to _fully_ read the [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines.

## Markdown Syntax

This repository uses special markdown syntax that helps style the resulting web version of the documentation.

### H6 Headings
H6 headings should be used above tables and code blocks to properly label them.

### Linking
Links between docs can be achieved by using a hash symbol (#), plus the markdown file name, plus another hash, and finally the dash-separated anchor. For instance, to link to the above H6 heading section:

```md
[Links to README.md H6](#README/h6-headings)
```

### Alert Boxes
Alert boxes are achieved by using a block quote that has one of 'warning', 'danger' or 'info' on the first line.

## Join the Unofficial Discord API Server
The Unofficial Discord API server is a common hangout for library and bot developers alike. It's a great starting point for those looking to dive in and learn bot-creation with the Discord API.
