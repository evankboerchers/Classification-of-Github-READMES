G\ (spelled G Backslash) is an elegant micro-framework that helps you to quickly build PHP web applications like never before. It applies a very sleek, intuitive and extensible MVC structure for your PHP apps. It does routing, themes, database handling (PDO) and route hooking.

G\ is all about making common core task of any modern PHP application a no brainer and give you all the tools to help you in this. G\ is not about making the actual coding job for you so if you want a framework that creates the database tables for you, handle login, sign-ups, validate forms, etc. G\ is not for you, **G\ is for developers who enjoy to code** and those developers doesn’t need that intrusive help.
