# ES2015 base project

This project uses Babel to transpile both back-end and front-end JavaScript on-the-fly, and SystemJS to load transpiled modules in the browser. See [HyperDev](https://hyperdev.com/#!/project/frill-bard) or [demo](https://frill-bard.hyperdev.space/).


## Usage

Change presets and other [Babel options](http://babeljs.io/docs/usage/options/) by updating the "babel" section of package.json


## How it works

1. HyperDev runs the `start` command which passes `server.js` through Babel (obeying options in package.json) and then runs the resulting JavaScript.
2. The `server.js` defines an Express server and middleware function which passes all requests ending in ".js" through Babel's `transformFile`.
3. User requests the index in their browser.
4. Back-end serves index.html.
5. Browser loads SystemJS.
5. Browser requests app.js.
6. Back-end transpiles app.js using same options from step 1, but with SystemJS module definitions.
5. Browser evaluates ES5 code generated by previous step.
