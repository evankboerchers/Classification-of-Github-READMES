**Spree** is a complete open source e-commerce solution built with Ruby on Rails. It
was started by Sean Schofield and is now developed by [Spark Solutions](http://sparksolutions.co). We're open to [contributions](#contributing).

Spree consists of several different gems (modules), each of which are maintained
in a single repository and documented in a single set of
[online documentation](http://guides.spreecommerce.org/).

* **spree_api** ([REST API v2](https://guides.spreecommerce.org/api/v2) with [JavaScript / TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/spree/spree-storefront-api-v2-js-sdk) and [REST API v1](https://guides.spreecommerce.org/api/))
* **spree_graphql** (GraphQL API - [coming soon](https://github.com/spree/spree/issues/9176))
* **spree_frontend** (mobile-first, blazing fast and customizable storefront)
* **spree_backend** (feature rich Admin Panel)
* **spree_cmd** (command-line tools for developers)
* **spree_core** (models, services & mailers, the basic components of Spree)
* **spree_sample** (sample data for demo purposes)

## Demo

Go to: https://demo.spreecommerce.org/
Explore demo features: https://spreecommerce.org/spree-commerce-demo-explainer/

Or fire up your own demo on Heroku:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/spree/spree/tree/4-1-stable)

Admin panel credentials for your own Heroku demo:

* login: `spree@example.com`
* password: `spree123`

## Installation

### Create new Rails app (optional)

If you're starting a new application from scrach run:

```bash
rails new my_store
cd my_store
```

You can **add Spree to your existing Rails application** as well.

### Add Spree gems to your `Gemfile`

#### Rails 6.0

```ruby
gem 'spree', '~> 4.1'
gem 'spree_auth_devise', '~> 4.2'
gem 'spree_gateway', '~> 3.9'
```

#### Rails 5.2

```ruby
gem 'spree', '~> 3.7.0'
gem 'spree_auth_devise', '~> 3.5'
gem 'spree_gateway', '~> 3.4'
```

To see what rails version are you using run this command:

```bash
rails -v
```

Older rails versions are also supported: [Rails 5.1](https://guides.spreecommerce.org/release_notes/3_5_0.html), [Rails 5.0](https://guides.spreecommerce.org/release_notes/3_2_0.html), [Rails 4.2](https://guides.spreecommerce.org/release_notes/3_1_0.html)

### Install gems

```bash
bundle install
```

**Note**: if you run into `Bundler could not find compatible versions for gem "sprockets":` error message, please run

```bash
bundle update
```

### Use the install generators to set up Spree

```shell
bundle exec rails g spree:install --user_class=Spree::User
bundle exec rails g spree:auth:install
bundle exec rails g spree_gateway:install
```

## Installation options

By default, the installation generator (`rails g spree:install`) will run
migrations as well as adding seed and sample data and will copy storefront data
for easy customization (if `spree_frontend` available). This can be disabled using

```shell
rails g spree:install --migrate=false --sample=false --seed=false --copy_storefront=false
```

You can always perform any of these steps later by using these commands.

```shell
bundle exec rake railties:install:migrations
bundle exec rails db:migrate
bundle exec rails db:seed
bundle exec rake spree_sample:load
bundle exec rails g spree:frontend:copy_storefront
```

### Headless installation

To use Spree in [API-only mode](https://guides.spreecommerce.org/api/overview/) you need to replace `spree` with `spree_api` in your project Gemfile. This will skip Storefront and Admin Panel. If you would want to include the Admin Panel please add `spree_backend` to your Gemfile.

## Run rails sever

```bash
rails s
```

## Browse Storefront

Go to http://localhost:3000

## Browse Admin Panel

Go to http://localhost:3000/admin
