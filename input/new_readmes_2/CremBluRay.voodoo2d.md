## Main Features

* Basic Game Infrastructure (GameLoop, Configuration, ...)
* 2D Render Engine (GUI Components, Spritesheet Animations, Ambient Lighting, Particle System, ...)
* 2D Sound Engine (support for .ogg)
* 2D Physics Engine
* Support for Tile Maps in .tmx format (e.g. made with [Tiled Editor](http://www.mapeditor.org/))
* Player input via Keyboard/Mouse

Code:
```java
Mesh mesh = Mesh.loadMesh("textures/player.png", 64); // Create new mesh with size of 64x64 pixels
GameObject gameObject = new GameObject(mesh); // Makes a new gameObject from mesh
Animation run = new Animation(gameObject, 0, 3, 6); // Creates new animation with frames 0 - 3 at 6 fps
run.play(); // Play the animation!
```

##### INPUT
```java
if(window.isKeyPressed(GLFW_KEY_D)) { // Checks if "D" key is down
    run.play(); // Plays our animation!
```

##### COLLISION
```java
aabb = new AABB(); // Make a new collision box
aabb.setCenter(0.5f, 0.0875f); // Set the center point of the boundary
aabb.setDistance(0.5f, 0.0875f); // Set the distance from the center to the edges of the boundary
```

### TROUBLESHOOTING
**A game object is not drawing to the screen!**
* Make sure you placed the game object in the gameObjects list that will be passed into the render method of the renderer.
* Check to see if the object has been instantiated properly.

**Animations are not diplaying properly**
* Ensure that you have given the proper range of sprites to be displayed from the spritesheet (i.e. 0 - 3).
* Remember that, when playing an animation, all other animations attached to that game object will be stopped.

**Something else isn't working properly**
* Open up an issue! Someone will get to it as soon as possible.

### Current Version
